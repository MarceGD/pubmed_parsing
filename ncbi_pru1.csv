0,10.1186/s12887-021-02909-4,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is a relatively rare inherited disease. Typical clinical presentation is important for the diagnosis of NS. But the initial presentation of NS could be significant variant individually which results in the difficult of working diagnosis. Here we report a rare neonatal case of NS who presented with refractory thrombocytopenia as the initial manifestation.
This was a preterm infant with refractory thrombocytopenia of unknown origin transferred from obstetric hospital at 6 weeks of age. During hospitalization, typical phenotypes of NS in addition to thrombocytopenia were observed, such as typical facial characteristics, short stature, atrial septal defect, cryptochidism, coagulation defect and chylothorax. Genetic testing showed a pathogenic variant at exon 2 of the PTPN11 gene with c.124A > G (p.T42A). Respiratory distress was deteriorated with progressive chylothorax. Chest tube was inserted for continuous draining. Chemical pleurodesis with erythromycin was tried twice, but barely effective. Finally, parents decided to withdraw medical care and the patient died.
Thrombocytopenia could be the first symptom of Noonan syndrome. After ruling out other common causes of thrombocytopenia, NS should be considered as the working diagnosis."
1,10.1016/j.jprot.2013.04.005,"SHP2/PTPN11 is a key regulator of cytokine, growth factor and integrin signaling. SHP2 influences cell survival, proliferation and differentiation by regulating major signaling pathways. Mutations in PTPN11 cause severe diseases like Noonan, LEOPARD syndrome or leukemia. Whereas several of these mutations result in altered enzymatic activity due to impaired auto-inhibition, not all disease patterns can be explained by this mechanism. In this study we analyzed altered binding properties of disease-related SHP2-mutants bearing point mutations within the SH2-domain (T42A, E139D, and R138Q). Mutants were chosen according to SPR assays, which revealed different binding properties of mutated SH2 towards phosphorylated receptor peptides. To analyze global changes in mutant binding properties we applied quantitative mass spectrometry (SILAC). Using an in vitro approach we identified overall more than 1000 protein candidates, which specifically bind to the SH2-domain of SHP2. We discovered that mutations in the SH2-domain selectively affected protein enrichment by altering the binding capacity of the SH2-domain. Mutation-dependent, enhanced or reduced exposure of SHP2 to its binding partners could have an impact on the dynamics of signaling networks. Thus, disease-associated mutants of SHP2 should not only be discussed in the context of deregulated auto-inhibition but also with respect to deregulated protein targeting of the SHP2 mutants.
Using quantitative mass spectrometry based proteomics we provided evidence that disease related mutations in SHP2 domains of SHP2 are able to influence SHP2 recruitment to its targets in mutation dependent manner. We discovered that mutations in the SH2-domain selectively affected protein enrichment ratios suggesting altered binding properties of the SH2-domain. We demonstrated that mutations within SHP2, which had been attributed to affect the enzymatic activity (i.e. affect the open/close status of SHP2), also differ in respect to binding properties. Our study indicates that SHP2 mutations need to be discussed not only in terms of deregulated auto-inhibition but also with respect to deregulated protein targeting properties of the SHP2 mutants. Discovery of the new binding partners for disease-related SHP2 mutants might provide a fruitful foundation for developing strategies targeting Noonan-associated leukemia."
2,10.1038/ejhg.2012.145,"Congenital heart defects affect 60-85% of patients with RASopathies. We analysed the clinical and molecular characteristics of atrioventricular canal defect in patients with mutations affecting genes coding for proteins with role in the RAS/MAPK pathway. Between 2002 and 2011, 101 patients with cardiac defect and a molecularly confirmed RASopathy were collected. Congenital heart defects within the spectrum of complete or partial (including cleft mitral valve) atrioventricular canal defect were diagnosed in 8/101 (8%) patients, including seven with a PTPN11 gene mutation, and one single subject with a RAF1 gene mutation. The only recurrent mutation was the missense PTPN11 c.124 A>G change (T42A) in PTPN11. Partial atrioventricular canal defect was found in six cases, complete in one, cleft mitral valve in one. In four subjects the defect was associated with other cardiac defects, including subvalvular aortic stenosis, mitral valve anomaly, pulmonary valve stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Maternal segregation of PTPN11 and RAF1 gene mutations occurred in two and one patients, respectively. Congenital heart defects in the affected relatives were discordant in the families with PTPN11 mutations, and concordant in that with RAF1 mutation. In conclusion, our data confirm previous reports indicating that atrioventricular canal defect represents a relatively common feature in Noonan syndrome. Among RASopathies, atrioventricular canal defect was observed to occur with higher prevalence among subjects with PTPN11 mutations, even though this association was not significant possibly because of low statistical power. Familial segregation of atrioventricular canal defect should be considered in the genetic counselling of families with RASopathies."
3,10.1093/hmg/ddn099,"Missense PTPN11 mutations cause Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes (NS and LS), two developmental disorders with pleiomorphic phenotypes. PTPN11 encodes SHP2, an SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase functioning as a signal transducer. Generally, different substitutions of a particular amino acid residue are observed in these diseases, indicating that the crucial factor is the residue being replaced. For a few codons, only one substitution is observed, suggesting the possibility of specific roles for the residue introduced. We analyzed the biochemical behavior and ligand-binding properties of all possible substitutions arising from single-base changes affecting codons 42, 139, 279, 282 and 468 to investigate the mechanisms underlying the invariant occurrence of the T42A, E139D and I282V substitutions in NS and the Y279C and T468M changes in LS. Our data demonstrate that the isoleucine-to-valine change at codon 282 is the only substitution at that position perturbing the stability of SHP2's closed conformation without impairing catalysis, while the threonine-to-alanine change at codon 42, but not other substitutions of that residue, promotes increased phosphopeptide-binding affinity. The recognition specificity of the C-SH2 domain bearing the E139D substitution differed substantially from its wild-type counterpart acquiring binding properties similar to those observed for the N-SH2 domain, revealing a novel mechanism of SHP2's functional dysregulation. Finally, while functional selection does not seem to occur for the substitutions at codons 279 and 468, we point to deamination of the methylated cytosine at nucleotide 1403 as the driving factor leading to the high prevalence of the T468M change in LS."
4,10.1002/ajmg.a.30789,"PTPN11 missense mutations cause approximately 50% of Noonan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder presenting with various congenital heart defects, most commonly valvar pulmonary stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Atrioventricular septal defects and coarctation of the aorta occur in 15% and 9%, respectively. The aim of this study was to determine if PTPN11 mutations exist in non-syndromic patients with these two relevant forms of congenital heart disease. The 15 coding PTPN11 exons and their intron boundaries from subjects with atrioventricular septal defects (n = 24) and coarctation of the aorta (n = 157) were analyzed using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced if abnormal. One subject with an atrioventricular septal defect but no other known medical problems had a c.127C > T transition in exon 2, predicting a p.L43F substitution. This mutation affected the phosphotyrosine-binding region in the N-terminal src homology 2 domain and was close to a Noonan syndrome mutation (p.T42A). An otherwise healthy patient with aortic coarctation had a silent c.540C > T change in exon 5 corresponding to p.D180D. Our study showed that PTPN11 mutations are rarely found in two isolated forms of congenital heart disease that commonly occur in Noonan syndrome. The p.L43F mutation belongs to a rare class of PTPN11 mutations altering the phosphotyrosine-binding region. These mutations are not predicted to alter the autoinhibition of the PTPN11 protein product, SHP-2, which is the mechanism for the vast majority of mutations causing Noonan syndrome. Future studies will be directed towards understanding these rare phosphotyrosine binding region mutants."
5,10.1073/pnas.0810053106,"Noonan syndrome (NS), the most common single-gene cause of congenital heart disease, is an autosomal dominant disorder that also features proportionate short stature, facial abnormalities, and an increased risk of myeloproliferative disease. Germline-activating mutations in PTPN11, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, cause about half of NS cases; other causative alleles include KRAS, SOS1, and RAF1 mutants. We showed previously that knock-in mice bearing the NS mutant Ptpn11(D61G) on a mixed 129S4/SvJae X C57BL6/J background exhibit all major NS features, including a variety of cardiac defects, with variable penetrance. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying NS cardiac defects and whether genetic background and/or the specific NS mutation contribute to the NS phenotype remained unclear. Here, using an inducible knock-in approach, we show that all cardiac defects in NS result from mutant Shp2 expression in the endocardium, not in the myocardium or neural crest. Furthermore, the penetrance of NS defects is affected by genetic background and the specific Ptpn11 allele. Finally, ex vivo assays and pharmacological approaches show that NS mutants cause cardiac valve defects by increasing Erk MAPK activation, probably downstream of ErbB family receptor tyrosine kinases, extending the interval during which cardiac endocardial cells undergo endocardial-mesenchymal transformation. Our data provide a mechanistic underpinning for the cardiac defects in this disorder."
