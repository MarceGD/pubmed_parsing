PTPN11,T42A,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is a relatively rare inherited disease. Typical clinical presentation is important for the diagnosis of NS. But the initial presentation of NS could be significant variant individually which results in the difficult of working diagnosis. Here we report a rare neonatal case of NS who presented with refractory thrombocytopenia as the initial manifestation.
This was a preterm infant with refractory thrombocytopenia of unknown origin transferred from obstetric hospital at 6 weeks of age. During hospitalization, typical phenotypes of NS in addition to thrombocytopenia were observed, such as typical facial characteristics, short stature, atrial septal defect, cryptochidism, coagulation defect and chylothorax. Genetic testing showed a pathogenic variant at exon 2 of the PTPN11 gene with c.124A > G (p.T42A). Respiratory distress was deteriorated with progressive chylothorax. Chest tube was inserted for continuous draining. Chemical pleurodesis with erythromycin was tried twice, but barely effective. Finally, parents decided to withdraw medical care and the patient died.
Thrombocytopenia could be the first symptom of Noonan syndrome. After ruling out other common causes of thrombocytopenia, NS should be considered as the working diagnosis.",10.1186/s12887-021-02909-4
PTPN11,T42A,"SHP2/PTPN11 is a key regulator of cytokine, growth factor and integrin signaling. SHP2 influences cell survival, proliferation and differentiation by regulating major signaling pathways. Mutations in PTPN11 cause severe diseases like Noonan, LEOPARD syndrome or leukemia. Whereas several of these mutations result in altered enzymatic activity due to impaired auto-inhibition, not all disease patterns can be explained by this mechanism. In this study we analyzed altered binding properties of disease-related SHP2-mutants bearing point mutations within the SH2-domain (T42A, E139D, and R138Q). Mutants were chosen according to SPR assays, which revealed different binding properties of mutated SH2 towards phosphorylated receptor peptides. To analyze global changes in mutant binding properties we applied quantitative mass spectrometry (SILAC). Using an in vitro approach we identified overall more than 1000 protein candidates, which specifically bind to the SH2-domain of SHP2. We discovered that mutations in the SH2-domain selectively affected protein enrichment by altering the binding capacity of the SH2-domain. Mutation-dependent, enhanced or reduced exposure of SHP2 to its binding partners could have an impact on the dynamics of signaling networks. Thus, disease-associated mutants of SHP2 should not only be discussed in the context of deregulated auto-inhibition but also with respect to deregulated protein targeting of the SHP2 mutants.
Using quantitative mass spectrometry based proteomics we provided evidence that disease related mutations in SHP2 domains of SHP2 are able to influence SHP2 recruitment to its targets in mutation dependent manner. We discovered that mutations in the SH2-domain selectively affected protein enrichment ratios suggesting altered binding properties of the SH2-domain. We demonstrated that mutations within SHP2, which had been attributed to affect the enzymatic activity (i.e. affect the open/close status of SHP2), also differ in respect to binding properties. Our study indicates that SHP2 mutations need to be discussed not only in terms of deregulated auto-inhibition but also with respect to deregulated protein targeting properties of the SHP2 mutants. Discovery of the new binding partners for disease-related SHP2 mutants might provide a fruitful foundation for developing strategies targeting Noonan-associated leukemia.",10.1016/j.jprot.2013.04.005
PTPN11,T42A,"Congenital heart defects affect 60-85% of patients with RASopathies. We analysed the clinical and molecular characteristics of atrioventricular canal defect in patients with mutations affecting genes coding for proteins with role in the RAS/MAPK pathway. Between 2002 and 2011, 101 patients with cardiac defect and a molecularly confirmed RASopathy were collected. Congenital heart defects within the spectrum of complete or partial (including cleft mitral valve) atrioventricular canal defect were diagnosed in 8/101 (8%) patients, including seven with a PTPN11 gene mutation, and one single subject with a RAF1 gene mutation. The only recurrent mutation was the missense PTPN11 c.124 A>G change (T42A) in PTPN11. Partial atrioventricular canal defect was found in six cases, complete in one, cleft mitral valve in one. In four subjects the defect was associated with other cardiac defects, including subvalvular aortic stenosis, mitral valve anomaly, pulmonary valve stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Maternal segregation of PTPN11 and RAF1 gene mutations occurred in two and one patients, respectively. Congenital heart defects in the affected relatives were discordant in the families with PTPN11 mutations, and concordant in that with RAF1 mutation. In conclusion, our data confirm previous reports indicating that atrioventricular canal defect represents a relatively common feature in Noonan syndrome. Among RASopathies, atrioventricular canal defect was observed to occur with higher prevalence among subjects with PTPN11 mutations, even though this association was not significant possibly because of low statistical power. Familial segregation of atrioventricular canal defect should be considered in the genetic counselling of families with RASopathies.",10.1038/ejhg.2012.145
PTPN11,T42A,"Missense PTPN11 mutations cause Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes (NS and LS), two developmental disorders with pleiomorphic phenotypes. PTPN11 encodes SHP2, an SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase functioning as a signal transducer. Generally, different substitutions of a particular amino acid residue are observed in these diseases, indicating that the crucial factor is the residue being replaced. For a few codons, only one substitution is observed, suggesting the possibility of specific roles for the residue introduced. We analyzed the biochemical behavior and ligand-binding properties of all possible substitutions arising from single-base changes affecting codons 42, 139, 279, 282 and 468 to investigate the mechanisms underlying the invariant occurrence of the T42A, E139D and I282V substitutions in NS and the Y279C and T468M changes in LS. Our data demonstrate that the isoleucine-to-valine change at codon 282 is the only substitution at that position perturbing the stability of SHP2's closed conformation without impairing catalysis, while the threonine-to-alanine change at codon 42, but not other substitutions of that residue, promotes increased phosphopeptide-binding affinity. The recognition specificity of the C-SH2 domain bearing the E139D substitution differed substantially from its wild-type counterpart acquiring binding properties similar to those observed for the N-SH2 domain, revealing a novel mechanism of SHP2's functional dysregulation. Finally, while functional selection does not seem to occur for the substitutions at codons 279 and 468, we point to deamination of the methylated cytosine at nucleotide 1403 as the driving factor leading to the high prevalence of the T468M change in LS.",10.1093/hmg/ddn099
PTPN11,T42A,"PTPN11 missense mutations cause approximately 50% of Noonan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder presenting with various congenital heart defects, most commonly valvar pulmonary stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Atrioventricular septal defects and coarctation of the aorta occur in 15% and 9%, respectively. The aim of this study was to determine if PTPN11 mutations exist in non-syndromic patients with these two relevant forms of congenital heart disease. The 15 coding PTPN11 exons and their intron boundaries from subjects with atrioventricular septal defects (n = 24) and coarctation of the aorta (n = 157) were analyzed using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced if abnormal. One subject with an atrioventricular septal defect but no other known medical problems had a c.127C > T transition in exon 2, predicting a p.L43F substitution. This mutation affected the phosphotyrosine-binding region in the N-terminal src homology 2 domain and was close to a Noonan syndrome mutation (p.T42A). An otherwise healthy patient with aortic coarctation had a silent c.540C > T change in exon 5 corresponding to p.D180D. Our study showed that PTPN11 mutations are rarely found in two isolated forms of congenital heart disease that commonly occur in Noonan syndrome. The p.L43F mutation belongs to a rare class of PTPN11 mutations altering the phosphotyrosine-binding region. These mutations are not predicted to alter the autoinhibition of the PTPN11 protein product, SHP-2, which is the mechanism for the vast majority of mutations causing Noonan syndrome. Future studies will be directed towards understanding these rare phosphotyrosine binding region mutants.",10.1002/ajmg.a.30789

PTPN11,D61G,"Most commonly used behavioral measures for testing learning and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) involve comparisons of an animal's residence time in different quadrants of the pool. Such measures are limited in their ability to test different aspects of the animal's performance. Here, we describe novel measures of performance in the MWM that use vector fields to capture the motion of mice as well as their search pattern in the maze. Using these vector fields, we develop quantitative measures of performance that are intuitive and more sensitive than classical measures. First, we describe search patterns in terms of vector field properties and use these properties to define three metrics of spatial memory namely Spatial Accuracy, Uncertainty and, Intensity of Search. We demonstrate the usefulness of these measures using four different data sets including comparisons between different strains of mice, an analysis of two mouse models of Noonan syndrome (NS; Ptpn11 D61G and Ptpn11 N308D/+), and a study of goal reversal training. Importantly, besides highlighting novel aspects of performance in this widely used spatial task, our measures were able to uncover previously undetected differences, including in an animal model of NS, which we rescued with the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor SL327. Thus, our results show that our approach breaks down performance in the MWM into sensitive measurable independent components that highlight differences in spatial learning and memory in the MWM that were undetected by conventional measures.",10.1002/hipo.23404
PTPN11,D61G,"Homeostatic scaling of the synapse, such as synaptic down-scaling, has been proposed to offset deleterious effects induced by sustained synaptic strength enhancement. Proper function and subcellular distribution of Src homology 2 domain-containing nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2) are required for synaptic plasticity. However, the role of SHP2 in synaptic down-scaling remains largely unknown. Here, using biochemical assays and cell-imaging techniques, we found that synaptic SHP2 levels are temporally regulated during synaptic down-scaling in cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, we observed that a Noonan syndrome-associated mutation of SHP2, resulting in a D61G substitution, prevents synaptic down-scaling. We further show that this effect is due to an inability of the SHP2-D61G variant to properly disassociate from postsynaptic density protein 95, leading to impaired SHP2 dispersion from synaptic sites after synaptic down-scaling. Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism of the Noonan syndrome-associated genetic variant SHP2-D61G that contributes to deficient synaptic down-scaling.",10.1074/jbc.RA119.010331
PTPN11,D61G,"Mutations in RAS signaling pathway components cause diverse neurodevelopmental disorders, collectively called RASopathies. Previous studies have suggested that dysregulation in RAS-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation is restricted to distinct cell types in different RASopathies. Some cases of Noonan syndrome (NS) are associated with gain-of-function mutations in the phosphatase SHP2 (encoded by ",10.1126/scisignal.aau5755
PTPN11,D61G,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is a common autosomal dominant congenital disorder which could cause the congenital cardiopathy and cancer predisposition. Previous studies reported that the knock-in mouse models of the mutant D61G of SHP2 exhibited the major features of NS, which demonstrated that the mutation D61G of SHP2 could cause NS. To explore the effect of D61G mutation on SHP2 and explain the high activity of the mutant, molecular dynamic simulations were performed on wild type (WT) of SHP2 and the mutated SHP2-D61G, respectively. The principal component analysis and dynamic cross-correlation mapping, associated with secondary structure, showed that the D61G mutation affected the motions of two regions (residues Asn 58-Thr 59 and Val 460-His 462) in SHP2 from β to turn. Moreover, the residue interaction networks analysis, the hydrogen bond occupancy analysis and the binding free energies were calculated to gain detailed insight into the influence of the mutant D61G on the two regions, revealing that the major differences between SHP2-WT and SHP2-D61G were the different interactions between Gly 61 and Gly 462, Gly 61 and Ala 461, Gln 506 and Ile 463, Gly 61 and Asn 58, Ile 463 and Thr 466, Gly 462 and Cys 459. Consequently, our findings here may provide knowledge to understand the increased activity of SHP2 caused by the mutant D61G.",10.1080/07391102.2017.1402709
PTPN11,D61G,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic fatal lung disease with dismal prognosis and no cure. The potential role of the ubiquitously expressed SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) as a therapeutic target has not been studied in IPF.
To determine the expression, mechanistic role, and potential therapeutic usefulness of SHP2 in pulmonary fibrosis.
The effects of SHP2 overexpression and inhibition on fibroblast response to profibrotic stimuli were analyzed in vitro in primary human and mouse lung fibroblasts. In vivo therapeutic effects were assessed in the bleomycin model of lung fibrosis by SHP2-lentiviral administration and transgenic mice carrying a constitutively active SHP2 mutation.
SHP2 was down-regulated in lungs and lung fibroblasts obtained from patients with IPF. Immunolocalization studies revealed that SHP2 was absent within fibroblastic foci. Loss of SHP2 expression or activity was sufficient to induce fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation in primary human lung fibroblasts. Overexpression of constitutively active SHP2 reduced the responsiveness of fibroblasts to profibrotic stimuli, including significant reductions in cell survival and myofibroblast differentiation. SHP2 effects were mediated through deactivation of fibrosis-relevant tyrosine kinase and serine/threonine kinase signaling pathways. Mice carrying the Noonan syndrome-associated gain-of-function SHP2 mutation (SHP2
Our data suggest that SHP2 is an important regulator of fibroblast differentiation, and its loss as observed in IPF facilitates profibrotic phenotypic changes. Augmentation of SHP2 activity or expression should be investigated as a novel therapeutic strategy for IPF.",10.1164/rccm.201602-0329OC
PTPN11,D61G,"Evidence suggests that Src homologous protein phosphotyrosyl phosphatase 2 (SHP2) mutations promote cancer development in several solid tumours. In this study, we focused on the in vivo and in vitro effects of an SHP2 mutation on the breast cancer phenotype to determine whether this mutation is correlated with a malignant phenotype.
Mutant PTPN11 cDNA (D61G) was transduced into MDA-MB231 and MCF-7 cells. The effects of the D61G mutation on tumourigenesis and malignant behaviours, such as cell adhesion, proliferation, migration and invasion, were examined. Potential underlying molecular mechanisms, i.e., activation of the Gab1-Ras-Erk axis, were also examined.
In vitro experiments revealed that tumour adhesion, proliferation, migration and invasion were significantly increased in the SHP2 D61G mutant groups. Consistently, in vivo experiments also showed that the tumour sizes and weights were increased significantly in the SHP2 D61G-MB231 group (p < 0.001) in association with tumour metastasis. Mechanistically, the PTPN11 mutation resulted in activation of the Ras-ErK pathway. The binding between Gab1 and mutant SHP2 was significantly increased.
Mutant SHP2 significantly promotes tumour migration and invasion at least partially through activation of the Gab1-Ras-Erk axis. This finding could have direct implications for breast cancer therapy.",10.18632/oncotarget.6561
PTPN11,D61G,"In Noonan syndrome (NS) 30-50% of subjects show cognitive deficits of unknown etiology and with no known treatment. Here, we report that knock-in mice expressing either of two NS-associated mutations in Ptpn11, which encodes the nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2, show hippocampal-dependent impairments in spatial learning and deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). In addition, viral overexpression of an NS-associated allele PTPN11(D61G) in adult mouse hippocampus results in increased baseline excitatory synaptic function and deficits in LTP and spatial learning, which can be reversed by a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor. Furthermore, brief treatment with lovastatin reduces activation of the GTPase Ras-extracellular signal-related kinase (Erk) pathway in the brain and normalizes deficits in LTP and learning in adult Ptpn11(D61G/+) mice. Our results demonstrate that increased basal Erk activity and corresponding baseline increases in excitatory synaptic function are responsible for the LTP impairments and, consequently, the learning deficits in mouse models of NS. These data also suggest that lovastatin or MEK inhibitors may be useful for treating the cognitive deficits in NS. ",10.1038/nn.3863
PTPN11,D61G,"Gain of function (GOF) mutations in protein tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn11 have been identified in childhood leukemias, and these mutations are sufficient to drive the development of myeloproliferative disorder and malignant leukemias in mice. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Ptpn11 mutations induce these malignancies are not completely understood. Here we report that Ptpn11 GOF mutations cause cytokine hypersensitivity in hematopoietic cells partly by enhancing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). GOF mutations D61G or E76K in Ptpn11 increased ROS levels in myeloid progenitors but not in hematopoietic stem cells. Increased ROS enhanced cellular responses to cytokines by promoting cytokine signaling. Treatment with an antioxidant partially corrected cytokine hypersensitivity in Ptpn11 mutant progenitors. Further analyses demonstrated that Ptpn11 mutations increased mitochondrial aerobic metabolism by interacting with a novel substrate in the mitochondria. This study provides new insights into the pathogenic effects of GOF mutations of Ptpn11 and implies that antioxidants may have a therapeutic benefit for the leukemic patients with these mutations.",10.1371/journal.pone.0063152
PTPN11,D61G,"Noonan syndrome (NS), a genetic disease caused in half of cases by activating mutations of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (PTPN11), is characterized by congenital cardiopathies, facial dysmorphic features, and short stature. How mutated SHP2 induces growth retardation remains poorly understood. We report here that early postnatal growth delay is associated with low levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in a mouse model of NS expressing the D61G mutant of SHP2. Conversely, inhibition of SHP2 expression in growth hormone (GH)-responsive cell lines results in increased IGF-1 release upon GH stimulation. SHP2-deficient cells display decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and rat sarcoma (RAS) activation in response to GH, whereas expression of NS-associated SHP2 mutants results in ERK1/2 hyperactivation in vitro and in vivo. RAS/ERK1/2 inhibition in SHP2-deficient cells correlates with impaired dephosphorylation of the adaptor Grb2-associated binder-1 (GAB1) on its RAS GTPase-activating protein (RASGAP) binding sites and is rescued by interfering with RASGAP recruitment or function. We demonstrate that inhibition of ERK1/2 activation results in an increase of IGF-1 levels in vitro and in vivo, which is associated with significant growth improvement in NS mice. In conclusion, NS-causing SHP2 mutants inhibit GH-induced IGF-1 release through RAS/ERK1/2 hyperactivation, a mechanism that could contribute to growth retardation. This finding suggests that, in addition to its previously shown beneficial effect on NS-linked cardiac and craniofacial defects, RAS/ERK1/2 modulation could also alleviate the short stature phenotype in NS caused by PTPN11 mutations.",10.1073/pnas.1119803109
PTPN11,D61G,"Germline and somatic gain-of-function mutations in tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11 (SHP-2) are associated with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), a myeloproliferative disease (MPD) of early childhood. The mechanism by which PTPN11 mutations induce this disease is not fully understood. Signaling partners that mediate the pathogenic effects of PTPN11 mutations have not been explored. Here we report that germ line mutation Ptpn11(D61G) in mice aberrantly accelerates hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) cycling, increases the stem cell pool, and elevates short-term and long-term repopulating capabilities, leading to the development of MPD. MPD is reproduced in primary and secondary recipient mice transplanted with Ptpn11(D61G/+) whole bone marrow cells or purified Lineage(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) cells, but not lineage committed progenitors. The deleterious effects of Ptpn11(D61G) mutation on HSCs are attributable to enhancing cytokine/growth factor signaling. The aberrant HSC activities caused by Ptpn11(D61G) mutation are largely corrected by deletion of Gab2, a prominent interacting protein and target of Shp-2 in cell signaling. As a result, MPD phenotypes are markedly ameliorated in Ptpn11(D61G/+)/Gab2(-/-) double mutant mice. Collectively, our data suggest that oncogenic Ptpn11 induces MPD by aberrant activation of HSCs. This study also identifies Gab2 as an important mediator for the pathogenic effects of Ptpn11 mutations.",10.1182/blood-2010-01-265652
PTPN11,D61G,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder, and a main feature is congenital heart malformation. About 50% of cases are caused by gain-of-function mutations in the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2/PTPN11, a downstream regulator of ERK/MAPK. Recently it was reported that SHP2 also localizes to the mitochondrial intercristae/intermembrane space (IMS), but the role of SHP2 in mitochondria is unclear. The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system provides the vast majority of cellular energy and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Changes in ROS may interfere with organ development such as that observed in NS patients. Several phosphorylation sites have been found in OxPhos components including cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) and cytochrome c (Cytc), and we hypothesized that OxPhos complexes may be direct or indirect targets of SHP2. We analyzed mitochondrial function using mouse fibroblasts from wild-types, SHP2 knockdowns, and D61G SHP2 mutants leading to constitutively active SHP2, as found in NS patients. Levels of OxPhos complexes were similar except for CcO and Cytc, which were 37% and 28% reduced in the D61G cells. However, CcO activity was significantly increased, as we also found for two lymphoblast cell lines from NS patients with two independent mutations in PTPN11. D61G cells showed lower mitochondrial membrane potential and 30% lower ATP content compared to controls. ROS were significantly increased; aconitase activity, a marker for ROS-induced damage, was decreased; and catalase activity was increased in D61G cells. We propose that decreased energy levels and/or increased ROS may explain, at least in part, some of the clinical features in NS that overlap with children with mitochondrial disorders.",10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.10.005
PTPN11,D61G,"Noonan syndrome (NS), the most common single-gene cause of congenital heart disease, is an autosomal dominant disorder that also features proportionate short stature, facial abnormalities, and an increased risk of myeloproliferative disease. Germline-activating mutations in PTPN11, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, cause about half of NS cases; other causative alleles include KRAS, SOS1, and RAF1 mutants. We showed previously that knock-in mice bearing the NS mutant Ptpn11(D61G) on a mixed 129S4/SvJae X C57BL6/J background exhibit all major NS features, including a variety of cardiac defects, with variable penetrance. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying NS cardiac defects and whether genetic background and/or the specific NS mutation contribute to the NS phenotype remained unclear. Here, using an inducible knock-in approach, we show that all cardiac defects in NS result from mutant Shp2 expression in the endocardium, not in the myocardium or neural crest. Furthermore, the penetrance of NS defects is affected by genetic background and the specific Ptpn11 allele. Finally, ex vivo assays and pharmacological approaches show that NS mutants cause cardiac valve defects by increasing Erk MAPK activation, probably downstream of ErbB family receptor tyrosine kinases, extending the interval during which cardiac endocardial cells undergo endocardial-mesenchymal transformation. Our data provide a mechanistic underpinning for the cardiac defects in this disorder.",10.1073/pnas.0810053106
PTPN11,D61G,"Mutations in SHP-2 phosphatase (PTPN11) that cause hyperactivation of its catalytic activity have been identified in Noonan syndrome and various childhood leukemias. Recent studies suggest that the gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of SHP-2 play a causal role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms by which GOF mutations of SHP-2 induce these phenotypes are not fully understood. Here, we show that GOF mutations in SHP-2, such as E76K and D61G, drastically increase spreading and migration of various cell types, including hematopoietic cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. More importantly, in vivo angiogenesis in SHP-2 D61G knock-in mice is also enhanced. Mechanistic studies suggest that the increased cell migration is attributed to the enhanced beta1 integrin outside-in signaling. In response to beta1 integrin cross-linking or fibronectin stimulation, activation of ERK and Akt kinases is greatly increased by SHP-2 GOF mutations. Also, integrin-induced activation of RhoA and Rac1 GTPases is elevated. Interestingly, mutant cells with the SHP-2 GOF mutation (D61G) are more sensitive than wild-type cells to the suppression of cell motility by inhibition of these pathways. Collectively, these studies reaffirm the positive role of SHP-2 phosphatase in cell motility and suggest a new mechanism by which SHP-2 GOF mutations contribute to diseases.",10.1074/jbc.M804129200
PTPN11,D61G,"Noonan syndrome is a common human autosomal dominant birth defect, characterized by short stature, facial abnormalities, heart defects and possibly increased risk of leukemia. Mutations of Ptpn11 (also known as Shp2), which encodes the protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp2, occur in approximately 50% of individuals with Noonan syndrome, but their molecular, cellular and developmental effects, and the relationship between Noonan syndrome and leukemia, are unclear. We generated mice expressing the Noonan syndrome-associated mutant D61G. When homozygous, the D61G mutant is embryonic lethal, whereas heterozygotes have decreased viability. Surviving Ptpn11(D61G/+) embryos ( approximately 50%) have short stature, craniofacial abnormalities similar to those in Noonan syndrome, and myeloproliferative disease. Severely affected Ptpn11(D61G/+) embryos ( approximately 50%) have multiple cardiac defects similar to those in mice lacking the Ras-GAP protein neurofibromin. Their endocardial cushions have increased Erk activation, but Erk hyperactivation is cell and pathway specific. Our results clarify the relationship between Noonan syndrome and leukemia and show that a single Ptpn11 gain-of-function mutation evokes all major features of Noonan syndrome by acting on multiple developmental lineages in a gene dosage-dependent and pathway-selective manner.",10.1038/nm1084
PTPN11,D61G,"Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder defined by short stature, delayed puberty, and characteristic dysmorphic features. Tartaglia et al. (Nature Genetics, 29:465-468) have recently shown that gain-of-function mutations in the gene PTPN11 (protein-tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor-type 11) cause Noonan syndrome in roughly half of patients that they examined. To further explore the relevance of PTPN11 mutations to the pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome, we analyzed the PTPN11 gene in 21 Japanese patients. Mutation analysis of the 15 coding exons and their flanking introns by denaturing HPLC and direct sequencing revealed six different heterozygous missense mutations (Asp61Gly, Tyr63Cys, Ala72Ser, Thr73Ile, Phe285Ser, and Asn308Asp) in seven cases (six sporadic and one familial). The mutations clustered either in the N-Src homology 2 domain or in the protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain. The clinical features of the mutation-positive and mutation-negative patients were comparable. The results provide further support to the notion that PTPN11 mutations are responsible for the development of Noonan syndrome in a substantial fraction of patients and that relatively infrequent features of Noonan syndrome, such as sensory deafness and bleeding diathesis, can also result from mutations of PTPN11.",10.1210/jcem.87.8.8694

Approximately 35% of patients with JMML occur D61Y mutation in PTPN11, and it increases the activity of the protein. However, the effect of the D61Y mutation on SHP2 conformations in molecular basis is poorly understood. Therefore, the molecular dynamics simulations on SHP2-D61Y and SHP2-WT were performed to explore the effect of D61Y mutation on SHP2 and explain the reason for high activity of SHP2-D61Y mutant. The study on the RMSF, per-residue RMSD, PCA, DCCM and secondary structure found that the flexibilities of regions (residues His458-Ser460 and Gln506-Ala509) in SHP2-D61Y were higher than the corresponding regions in SHP2-WT, and the conformations of these regions almost transformed from α-helix and β-strand to Turn, respectively. Thus, the catalytical sites in the PTP domain (residues Asn217-Thr524) were exposed to the substrate easily, which contributed to the enhancement of SHP2-D61Y activity. Moreover, the residue interaction network, H bond occupancy and binding free energy were calculated, revealing that conformational difference were caused by distinctions in residue-residue interactions between Asp/Tyr61-Gln506, Gln506-Gln510, Gln506-Phe251, Gln506-Gly60, Gln506-Tyr63, Asp/Tyr61-Cys459, Cys459-Ile463 and Cys459-Arg465.

PTPN11,D61Y,"Activating mutations, such as E76K and D61Y, in PTPN11 (SHP2), a protein tyrosine phosphatase implicated in multiple cell signaling processes, are associated with 35% of patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), an aggressive childhood myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Here we show that the interaction between leukemia-associated mutant Shp2 and Gab2, a scaffolding protein important for cytokine-induced PI3K/Akt signaling, was enhanced, and that the mTOR pathway was elevated in Ptpn11",10.1038/leu.2016.326
PTPN11,D61Y,"t(8;21) is one of the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, expression of AML1-ETO is not sufficient to induce transformation in vivo. Consistent with this observation, patients with this translocation harbor additional genetic abnormalities, suggesting a requirement for cooperating mutations. To better define the genetic landscape in AML and distinguish driver from passenger mutations, we compared the mutational profiles of AML1-ETO-driven mouse models of leukemia with the mutational profiles of human AML patients. We identified TET2 and PTPN11 mutations in both mouse and human AML and then demonstrated the ability of Tet2 loss and PTPN11 D61Y to initiate leukemogenesis in concert with expression of AML1-ETO in vivo. This integrative genetic profiling approach allowed us to accurately predict cooperating events in t(8;21)(+) AML in a robust and unbiased manner, while also revealing functional convergence in mouse and human AML.

PTPN11,D61Y,"Macrophages are vital to innate immunity and express pattern recognition receptors and integrins for the rapid detection of invading pathogens. Stimulation of Dectin-1 and complement receptor 3 (CR3) activates Erk- and Akt-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Shp2, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase encoded by Ptpn11, promotes activation of Ras-Erk and PI3K-Akt and is crucial for hematopoietic cell function; however, no studies have examined Shp2 function in particulate-stimulated ROS production. Maximal Dectin-1-stimulated ROS production corresponded kinetically to maximal Shp2 and Erk phosphorylation. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) from mice with a conditionally deleted allele of Ptpn11 (Shp2(flox/flox);Mx1Cre+) produced significantly lower ROS levels compared with control BMMs. Although YFP-tagged phosphatase dead Shp2-C463A was strongly recruited to the early phagosome, its expression inhibited Dectin-1- and CR3-stimulated phospho-Erk and ROS levels, placing Shp2 phosphatase function and Erk activation upstream of ROS production. Further, BMMs expressing gain of function Shp2-D61Y or Shp2-E76K and peritoneal exudate macrophages from Shp2D61Y/+;Mx1Cre+ mice produced significantly elevated levels of Dectin-1- and CR3-stimulated ROS, which was reduced by pharmacologic inhibition of Erk. SIRPα (signal regulatory protein α) is a myeloid inhibitory immunoreceptor that requires tyrosine phosphorylation to exert its inhibitory effect. YFP-Shp2C463A-expressing cells have elevated phospho-SIRPα levels and an increased Shp2-SIRPα interaction compared with YFP-WT Shp2-expressing cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that Shp2 phosphatase function positively regulates Dectin-1- and CR3-stimulated ROS production in macrophages by dephosphorylating and thus mitigating the inhibitory function of SIRPα and by promoting Erk activation.

PTPN11,D61Y,"Activating PTPN11 mutants promote hematopoietic progenitor hyperactivation of Erk and hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. We hypothesized that Kinase Suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1) contributes to activating PTPN11-induced GM-CSF hypersensitivity. Bone marrow progenitors from WT and KSR1-/- mice expressing WT Shp2, Shp2E76K, or Shp2D61Y were evaluated functionally and biochemically. KSR1 activation and interaction with phospho-Erk was enhanced in Shp2D61Y- and ShpE76K-expressing cells. Genetic disruption of KSR1 partially normalized Shp2E76K-induced GM-CSF hypersensitivity, but failed to correct Shp2D61Y-induced GM-CSF hypersensitivity. Collectively, these studies suggest that cells expressing Shp2E76K have a greater dependence on KSR1 for GM-CSF hypersensitivity than cells expressing Shp2D61Y.",10.1016/j.leukres.2011.04.003
PTPN11,D61Y,"PTPN11, which encodes the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, is mutated in approximately 35% of patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and at a lower incidence in other neoplasms. To model JMML pathogenesis, we generated knockin mice that conditionally express the leukemia-associated mutant Ptpn11(D61Y). Expression of Ptpn11(D61Y) in all hematopoietic cells evokes a fatal myeloproliferative disorder (MPD), featuring leukocytosis, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and factor-independent colony formation by bone marrow (BM) and spleen cells. The Lin(-)Sca1(+)cKit(+) (LSK) compartment is expanded and ""right-shifted,"" accompanied by increased stem cell factor (SCF)-evoked colony formation and Erk and Akt activation. However, repopulating activity is decreased in diseased mice, and mice that do engraft with Ptpn11(D61Y) stem cells fail to develop MPD. Ptpn11(D61Y) common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) produce cytokine-independent colonies in a cell-autonomous manner and demonstrate elevated Erk and Stat5 activation in response to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulation. Ptpn11(D61Y) megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs) yield increased numbers of erythrocyte burst-forming units (BFU-Es), but MEPs and erythrocyte-committed progenitors (EPs) produce fewer erythrocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Es), indicating defective erythroid differentiation. Our studies provide a mouse model for Ptpn11-evoked MPD and show that this disease results from cell-autonomous and distinct lineage-specific effects of mutant Ptpn11 on multiple stages of hematopoiesis.",10.1182/blood-2008-10-182626
PTPN11,D61Y,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a lethal disease of young children characterized by hypersensitivity of hematopoietic progenitors to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Mutations in PTPN11, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2, are common in JMML. We hypothesized that PTPN11 mutations induce hypersensitivity of hematopoietic progenitors to GM-CSF and confer increased GM-CSF-stimulated phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) levels. To test this hypothesis, the wild-type (WT) and 3 mutant Ptpn11 cDNAs (E76K, D61V, and D61Y) were transduced into murine bone marrow cells to examine GM-CSF-stimulated granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) growth, macrophage progenitor proliferation, and activation of the Ras signaling pathway. Expression of the Shp-2 mutants induced progenitor cell hypersensitivity to GM-CSF compared with cells transduced with vector alone or WT Shp-2. Macrophage progenitors expressing the Shp-2 mutants displayed both basal and GM-CSF-stimulated hyperproliferation compared with cells transduced with vector alone or WT Shp-2. Consistently, macrophage progenitors transduced with the Shp-2 mutants demonstrated constitutively elevated phospho-Erk levels and sustained activation of phospho-Erk following GM-CSF stimulation compared with vector alone or WT Shp-2. These data support the hypothesis that PTPN11 mutations induce hematopoietic progenitor hypersensitivity to GM-CSF due to hyperactivation of the Ras signaling axis and provide a basis for the GM-CSF signaling pathway as a target for rational drug design in JMML.",10.1182/blood-2004-10-4002
PTPN11,D61Y,"Noonan syndrome was recently reported to be caused by mutations in the PTPN11 gene in 40% of the cases. This gene encodes the nonreceptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 and has been shown to be self down-regulated with the concurrency of two SH2 domains. Insertion of a specific loop (D'EF) from N-terminal SH2 domain into the SHP-2 active-site is responsible for the reversible inhibition of the phosphatase activity. Here we report the first in frame trinucleotide deletion resulting in the removal of Aspartate 61 (D61del), a key residue of the N-terminal SH2 D'EF loop. Energetic-based structural analysis and electrostatic calculations carried out on the wild-type and mutant proteins predict lower stability of the D'EF loop for the D61del variant as compared to the wild type indicating better access to the active site and most likely an enzyme activated for longer extent. Similar computations were performed on the previously functionally characterized gain-of-function D61Y mutant and similar behaviors were observed. The simulation data for the D61del and D61Y mutants suggest that both variants could yield more catalytic cycles than the wild-type molecule in the same timespan because of the opening of the active site. It also supports the notion that D61 plays a major role for proper down-regulation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity of SHP-2.",10.1002/prot.20296
PTPN11,A72S,"Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder defined by short stature, delayed puberty, and characteristic dysmorphic features. Tartaglia et al. (Nature Genetics, 29:465-468) have recently shown that gain-of-function mutations in the gene PTPN11 (protein-tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor-type 11) cause Noonan syndrome in roughly half of patients that they examined. To further explore the relevance of PTPN11 mutations to the pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome, we analyzed the PTPN11 gene in 21 Japanese patients. Mutation analysis of the 15 coding exons and their flanking introns by denaturing HPLC and direct sequencing revealed six different heterozygous missense mutations (Asp61Gly, Tyr63Cys, Ala72Ser, Thr73Ile, Phe285Ser, and Asn308Asp) in seven cases (six sporadic and one familial). The mutations clustered either in the N-Src homology 2 domain or in the protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain. The clinical features of the mutation-positive and mutation-negative patients were comparable. The results provide further support to the notion that PTPN11 mutations are responsible for the development of Noonan syndrome in a substantial fraction of patients and that relatively infrequent features of Noonan syndrome, such as sensory deafness and bleeding diathesis, can also result from mutations of PTPN11.",10.1210/jcem.87.8.8694
PTPN11,T73I,"Nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) is still a challenging diagnosis. The differential diagnosis is extensive and the success of identifying a cause depends on the thoroughness of efforts to establish a diagnosis. For the early diagnosis of NIHF, a virtual gene panel diagnostic tool was developed. The female premature baby in question was delivered via emergency cesarean at 30 + 1 weeks of gestational age (GA) due to rapidly developing NIHF to a healthy mother. The family history was noncontributory.
DNA of the family was extracted and sequenced by the virtual hydrops panel with whole-exome sequencing.
The hydrops panel revealed Noonan syndrome (NS) with a germline mutation in PTPN11 c.218C>T (p.Thr73Ile).
The diagnosis of our patient was rapidly confirmed by the hydrops panel. The variant of c.218C>T (p.Thr73Ile) has not yet been described in literature relating to NIHF. Only a few case reports of this variant are known. This particular mutation is associated with Noonan syndrome, congenital heart defect and persistent thrombocytopenia. Few reveal juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.",10.1002/mgg3.1174
PTPN11,T73I,"Most cases of Noonan syndrome (NS) result from mutations in one of the RAS-MAPK signaling genes, including PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, NRAS, RAF1, BRAF, SHOC2, MEK1 (MAP2K1), and CBL. Cardiovascular diseases of varying severity, such as pulmonary stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), are common in NS patients. RAF1 mutations are most frequent in NS with HCM, while PTPN11 mutations are also well known. Thr73Ile is a gain-of-function mutation of PTPN11, which has been highly associated with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and NS/myeloproliferative disease (MPD), but has not previously been reported in HCM. Here, we report a Japanese female infant with NS carrying the PTPN11 T73I mutation with NS/MPD, complete atrio-ventricular septal defect, and rapidly progressive HCM. No other HCM-related mutations were detected in PTPN11, RAF1, KRAS, BRAF, and SHOC2. This patient provides additional information regarding the genotype-phenotype correlation for PTPN11 T73I mutation in NS.",10.1002/ajmg.a.37295
PTPN11,T73I,"Infants with Noonan syndrome (NS) are predisposed to developing juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) or JMML-like myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). Whereas sporadic JMML is known to be aggressive, JMML occurring in patients with NS is often considered as benign and transitory. However, little information is available regarding the occurrence and characteristics of JMML in NS.
Within a large prospective cohort of 641 patients with a germline PTPN11 mutation, we identified MPD features in 36 (5.6%) patients, including 20 patients (3%) who fully met the consensus diagnostic criteria for JMML. Sixty percent of the latter (12/20) had severe neonatal manifestations, and 10/20 died in the first month of life. Almost all (11/12) patients with severe neonatal JMML were males. Two females who survived MPD/JMML subsequently developed another malignancy during childhood. Although the risk of developing MPD/JMML could not be fully predicted by the underlying PTPN11 mutation, some germline PTPN11 mutations were preferentially associated with myeloproliferation: 10/48 patients with NS (20.8%) with a mutation in codon Asp61 developed MPD/JMML in infancy. Patients with a p.Thr73Ile mutation also had more chances of developing MPD/JMML but with a milder clinical course. SNP array and whole exome sequencing in paired tumoral and constitutional samples identified no second acquired somatic mutation to explain the occurrence of myeloproliferation.
JMML represents the first cause of death in PTPN11-associated NS. Few patients have been reported so far, suggesting that JMML may sometimes be overlooked due to early death, comorbidities or lack of confirmatory tests.",10.1136/jmedgenet-2014-102611
PTPN11,T73I,"We observed a neonate with severe congenital thrombocytopenia and features of Noonan syndrome where evaluations were negative for immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, congenital infections, and Fanconi anemia. The marrow findings and a significantly elevated plasma thrombopoietin (Tpo) level were consistent with congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia; we sought a genetic mutation that could explain this phenotype. No mutations were identified in c-MPL (the Tpo receptor gene). Microarray analysis of peripheral blood did not reveal an abnormality. DNA sequencing of the PTPN11 gene showed a heterozygous C>T nucleotide substitution in exon 3 (c.218C>T) predicted to result in a threonine-to-isoleucine change at residue 73 (T73I). A 6-week trial of eltrombopag (an agonist of the Tpo receptor) failed to increase the platelet count. We propose this specific PTPN11 mutation results in abnormalities of the protein product SHP-2, which, because of its role in signal transduction, results in severe congenital thrombocytopenia refractory to c-MPL agonists.

PTPN11,T73I,"Noonan-like/multiple giant cell lesion syndrome (NS/MGCLS) is a rare condition with phenotypic overlap with Noonan syndrome (NS). Once thought to be a specific and separate entity, it is now suggested to be a variant of the NS spectrum. We report a patient with classical cardinal features of NS, including short stature, mild ptosis, hypertelorism, down-slating palpebral fissures, low-set and posteriorly angulated ears, short neck, pectus excavatum, widely spaced nipples and cryptochidism, which were associated with bilateral central giant cell lesions in the mandible and germ-line mutation (C218T, Thr73Ile) in the exon 3 of the PTPN11 gene. The similar clinical and genetic aspects support the observation that NS/MGCLS is a variant of NS and giant cell lesions are an integrant part of this disorder.",10.1007/s12105-010-0178-2
PTPN11,T73I,"Mutations in the PTPN11 gene are known to cause a large fraction of the cases of Noonan syndrome. The objective of this study was to determine the PTPN11 gene mutation rate in a cohort of clinically well-characterized Brazilian patients with Noonan or Noonan-like syndromes and to study the genotype-phenotype correlation. Fifty probands with Noonan syndrome ascertained according to well-established diagnostic criteria, 3 with LEOPARD syndrome, 5 with Noonan-like/multiple giant cell lesion syndrome, and 3 with neurofibromatosis/ Noonan were enrolled in this study. Mutational analysis was performed using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) followed by sequencing of amplicons with an aberrant elution profile. We detected missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene in 21 probands with Noonan syndrome (42%), in all 3 patients with LEOPARD syndrome, and in 1 case with Noonan-like/multiple giant cell lesion syndrome. One patient with neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome had a mutation in both the PTPN11 and NF1 genes. The only anomalies that reached statistical significance when comparing probands with and without mutations were the hematological abnormalities. Our data confirms that Noonan syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, with mutations in the PTPN11 gene responsible for roughly 50% of the cases. A definitive genotype-phenotype correlation has not been established, but the T73I mutation seems to predispose to a myeloproliferative disorder. Regarding Noonan-like syndromes, mutation of the PTPN11 gene is the main causal factor in LEOPARD syndrome, and it also plays a role in neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome. Noonan- like/multiple giant cell lesion syndrome, part of the spectrum of Noonan syndrome, is also heterogeneous.",10.1089/gte.2006.10.186
PTPN11,T73I,"Germ line PTPN11 mutations cause 50% of cases of Noonan syndrome (NS). Somatic mutations in PTPN11 occur in 35% of patients with de novo, nonsyndromic juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), either transient or more fulminant forms, can also occur in infants with NS (NS/MPD). We identified PTPN11 mutations in blood or bone marrow specimens from 77 newly reported patients with JMML (n = 69) or NS/MPD (n = 8). Together with previous reports, we compared the spectrum of PTPN11 mutations in 3 groups: (1) patients with JMML (n = 107); (2) patients with NS/MPD (n = 19); and (3) patients with NS (n = 243). Glu76 was the most commonly affected residue in JMML (n = 45), with the Glu76Lys alteration (n = 29) being most frequent. Eight of 19 patients with NS/MPD carried the Thr73Ile substitution. These data suggest that there is a genotype/phenotype correlation in the spectrum of PTPN11 mutations found in patients with JMML, NS/MPD, and NS. This supports the need to characterize the spectrum of hematologic abnormalities in individuals with NS and to better define the impact of the PTPN11 lesion on the disease course in patients with NS/MPD and JMML.",10.1182/blood-2005-02-0531
PTPN11,T73I,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by short stature, minor facial anomalies, and congenital heart defects. In approximately 50% of cases the condition is caused by missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene on chromosome 12, resulting in a gain of function of the protein SHP-2. In this study, PTPN11 mutation analysis was performed in 170 NS patients. In 76 (45%) of them a mutation was identified. We report on the distribution of these mutations, as well as on genotype-phenotype relationships. The benefit of the NS scoring system developed by van der Burgt et al. [(1994); Am J Med Genet 53:187-191] is shown, among physicians who consequently based their diagnosis on the NS scoring system the percentage mutation positive subjects was 54%, whereas this percentage was only 39% among physicians who made less use of the scoring system. In two patients with some uncommon manifestations mutations were found in the C-SH2 domain, a region in which defects are not often identified in NS. A trend was observed in patients carrying the 922A --> G change (Asn308Asp) receiving normal education. In one patient with NS and mild juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) the mutation 218C --> T (Thr73Ile) was found. This confirms previous findings indicating that individuals with NS with specific mutations in PTPN11 are at risk of developing JMML.",10.1002/ajmg.a.30598

PTPN11,E76D,"Molecular analysis of the gene encoding the protein tyrosine phospatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11), identified a single base change at nucleotide 228 in an individual manifesting Noonan syndrome with aortic root widening and dysplastic aortic and mitral valves. This missense mutation changes glutamate to aspartate at position 76 of the protein (E76D or Glu76Asp), which likely disrupts intramolecular hydrogen bonding of this protein. There are few reports of aortic root dilatation in Noonan syndrome, and to our knowledge this is the first case with a confirmed PTPN11 mutation.",10.1007/s00246-006-1210-x
PTPN11,E76K,"Mutations in PTPN11, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, contribute to ∼35% of cases of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). A common clinical picture in children with JMML is that it presents as a constitutive hyperinflammatory syndrome, partially reminiscent of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in adults. Thus, a component of JMML is associated with a hyperinflammatory state and abundant innate immune cells such as neutrophils and monocytes. Recently, we showed that the evolutionarily conserved mouse lncRNA Morrbid is specifically expressed in myeloid cells and uniquely represses the expression of the proapoptotic gene Bim to regulate the lifespan of myeloid cells. However, its role in JMML has not been investigated. In this study, we characterized the role of Morrbid and its target Bim, which are significantly dysregulated in Shp2E76K/+-bearing myeloid cells, in driving JMML. Loss of Morrbid in a mouse model of JMML driven by the Shp2E76K/+ mutation resulted in a significant correction of myeloid and erythroid cell abnormalities associated with JMML, including overall survival. Consistently, patients with JMML who had PTPN11, KRAS, and NRAS mutations and high expression of MORRBID manifested poor overall survival. Our results suggest that Morrbid contributes to JMML pathogenesis.",10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002123
PTPN11,E76K,"B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is immune to the chemotherapy-induced apoptosis as a result of the protection of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs). However, the precise underlying mechanism of such protection remains unclear so far. In this experiment, protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (Shp2), which was encoded by the PTPN11 gene, was highly expressed in BMSCs of the newly diagnosed and the recurrent B-ALL patients. The plasmid-induced (including Shp2 E76K) Shp2 activation in BMSCs (Shp2-activated BMSCs) markedly increased the BMSCs-mediated resistance of leukemia cells both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, studies in vitro suggested that, the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) was markedly up-regulated in Shp2-activated BMSCs, and VCAM-1 expression in BMSCs of B-ALL patients was negatively correlated with Shp2 expression. Down-regulation of VCAM-1 in BMSCs using siRNA reversed the resistance of CCRF-SB cells mediated by the Shp2-activated BMSCs. As for the molecular mechanism, the PI3K/AKT pathway mediated the regulation of VCAM-1 by Shp2. Blocking the very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) by antibodies in CCRF-SB cells dramatically reversed the resistance of CCRF-SB cells mediated by the Shp2-activated BMSCs, and decreased the adhesion effects of both CCRF-SB cells and BMSCs. In conclusion, Shp2 activation in BMSCs up-regulates VCAM-1 expression through increasing the PI3K/AKT phosphorylation level, and targeting the VCAM-1/VLA-4 signaling may serve as a clinically relevant mechanism to overcome the BMSCs-mediated chemoresistance of B-ALL cells.",10.1016/j.intimp.2019.106008

Outcomes for many children with JMML remain dismal with current standard-of-care cytoreductive chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We used patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to characterize the signaling profiles and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities of PTPN11-mutant and CBL-mutant JMML. We assessed whether MEK, JAK, and PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitors (i) could inhibit myeloproliferation and aberrant signaling in iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitors with PTPN11 E76K or CBL Y371H mutations. We detected constitutive Ras/MAPK and PI3K/mTOR signaling in PTPN11 and CBL iPSC-derived myeloid cells. Activated signaling and growth of PTPN11 iPSCs were preferentially inhibited in vitro by the MEKi PD0325901 and trametinib. Conversely, JAK/STAT signaling was selectively activated in CBL iPSCs and abrogated by the JAKi momelotinib and ruxolitinib. The PI3Kδi idelalisib and mTORi rapamycin inhibited signaling and myeloproliferation in both PTPN11 and CBL iPSCs. These findings demonstrate differential sensitivity of PTPN11 iPSCs to MEKi and of CBL iPSCs to JAKi, but similar sensitivity to PI3Ki and mTORi.

The patient underwent finger amputation and resection of lung nodules. The amputation specimen and lung nodules revealed features of AS. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for FOS and FOSB gene rearrangements were negative in the primary tumor as well as in the lung metastasis. Intrigued by the unique morphologic features of an AS masquerading as an EH, we expanded our study by analyzing mutations in EHs versus ASs using a targeted next-generation sequencing of 50 cancer-related genes. Seven EHs and 6 ASs including the present case were subjected to mutation analysis using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 assay of 50 cancer-related genes. The present case lacked mutation. Novel somatic variants were detected in 2 of 7 EHs and 1 of 6 ASs. Sorting intolerant from tolerant and polymorphism phenotyping analysis revealed benign/tolerated and deleterious variants in both tumor types. Deleterious variants TP53 c.707T>C (p.Tyr236Cys), FLT3 c.1995C>T (p.Met665Ile), and SMO c.1919C>T (p.Thr640Ile) were detected in EH, while AS revealed deleterious variant PTPN11 c.226G>A (p.Glu76Lys).
We present an epithelioid AS mimicking EH. We report novel somatic variants in EHs and AS. Benign variants may not be associated with development of these tumors. Whereas, deleterious variants, especially PTPN11 c.226G>A, may be linked to tumorigenesis of AS.",10.1097/PAI.0000000000000551
PTPN11,E76K,"Accumulating evidence suggests the origin of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is closely associated with fetal development. Nevertheless, the contribution of embryonic progenitors to JMML pathogenesis remains unexplored.

PTPN11,E76K,"Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is an aggressive malignant neoplasm of dendritic cell origin that is common in certain breeds of dogs. High prevalence of fatal, disseminated HS has been described in Bernese Mountain Dogs (BMDs). Support for genetic predisposition to develop HS has been presented in several studies, but to date, causative genetic events have not been reported. In addition, no driver mutations have been identified in tumours. Recently, E76K gain-of-function mutation in SHP2 encoded by the PTPN11 gene has been described in human histiocytic malignancies.

Here we show that the interaction between leukemia-associated mutant Shp2 and Gab2, a scaffolding protein important for cytokine-induced PI3K/Akt signaling, was enhanced, and that the mTOR pathway was elevated in Ptpn11",10.1038/leu.2016.326
PTPN11,E76K,"After allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, nonhematopoietic tissues contain donor-derived cells; however, whether cells from malignant hematological disease can also be found in nonhematopoietic tissues is unclear. This report describes a juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) case with a typical PTPN11 mutation (p.E76K) at different allele frequencies in the bone marrow mononuclear cells, buccal smear cells, and fingernails at diagnosis, which was suggestive of PTPN11 somatic mosaicism; however, the PTPN11 mutation in the buccal smear cells and fingernails was lost after unrelated cord blood transplantation. These results suggest that JMML-derived cells may migrate into and reside in nonhematopoietic tissues and furthermore that these cells can be eradicated by cord blood transplantation.

PTPN11,E76K,"Macrophages are vital to innate immunity and express pattern recognition receptors and integrins for the rapid detection of invading pathogens. Stimulation of Dectin-1 and complement receptor 3 (CR3) activates Erk- and Akt-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Shp2, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase encoded by Ptpn11, promotes activation of Ras-Erk and PI3K-Akt and is crucial for hematopoietic cell function; however, no studies have examined Shp2 function in particulate-stimulated ROS production. Maximal Dectin-1-stimulated ROS production corresponded kinetically to maximal Shp2 and Erk phosphorylation. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) from mice with a conditionally deleted allele of Ptpn11 (Shp2(flox/flox);Mx1Cre+) produced significantly lower ROS levels compared with control BMMs. Although YFP-tagged phosphatase dead Shp2-C463A was strongly recruited to the early phagosome, its expression inhibited Dectin-1- and CR3-stimulated phospho-Erk and ROS levels, placing Shp2 phosphatase function and Erk activation upstream of ROS production. Further, BMMs expressing gain of function Shp2-D61Y or Shp2-E76K and peritoneal exudate macrophages from Shp2D61Y/+;Mx1Cre+ mice produced significantly elevated levels of Dectin-1- and CR3-stimulated ROS, which was reduced by pharmacologic inhibition of Erk. SIRPα (signal regulatory protein α) is a myeloid inhibitory immunoreceptor that requires tyrosine phosphorylation to exert its inhibitory effect. YFP-Shp2C463A-expressing cells have elevated phospho-SIRPα levels and an increased Shp2-SIRPα interaction compared with YFP-WT Shp2-expressing cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that Shp2 phosphatase function positively regulates Dectin-1- and CR3-stimulated ROS production in macrophages by dephosphorylating and thus mitigating the inhibitory function of SIRPα and by promoting Erk activation.

PTPN11,E76K,"Lung cancer is a major disease carrying heterogeneous molecular lesions and many of them remain to be analyzed functionally in vivo. Gain-of-function (GOF) SHP2 (PTPN11) mutations have been found in various types of human cancer, including lung cancer. However, the role of activating SHP2 mutants in lung cancer has not been established. We generated transgenic mice containing a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible activating SHP2 mutant (tetO-SHP2(E76K)) and analyzed the role of SHP2(E76K) in lung tumorigenesis in the Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP)-reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA)/tetO-SHP2(E76K) bitransgenic mice. SHP2(E76K) activated Erk1/Erk2 (Erk1/2) and Src, and upregulated c-Myc and Mdm2 in the lungs of bitransgenic mice. Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and small adenomas were observed in CCSP-rtTA/tetO-SHP2(E76K) bitransgenic mice induced with Dox for 2-6 months and progressed to larger adenoma and adenocarcinoma by 9 months. Dox withdrawal from bitransgenic mice bearing magnetic resonance imaging-detectable lung tumors resulted in tumor regression. These results show that the activating SHP2 mutant promotes lung tumorigenesis and that the SHP2 mutant is required for tumor maintenance in this mouse model of non-small cell lung cancer. SHP2(E76K) was associated with Gab1 in the lung of transgenic mice. Elevated pGab1 was observed in the lung of Dox-induced CCSP-rtTA/tetO-SHP2(E76K) mice and in cell lines expressing SHP2(E76K), indicating that the activating SHP2 mutant autoregulates tyrosine phosphorylation of its own docking protein. Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation is sensitive to inhibition by the Src inhibitor dasatinib in GOF SHP2-mutant-expressing cells, suggesting that Src family kinases are involved in SHP2 mutant-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation.

PTPN11,E76K,"Activating mutations of PTPN11 (encoding the SHP2 phosphatase) are associated with Noonan syndrome, childhood leukemias, and sporadic solid tumors. Virtual screening combined with experimental assays was performed to identify inhibitors of SHP2 from a database of natural products. This effort led to the identification of cryptotanshinone as an inhibitor of SHP2. Cryptotanshinone inhibited SHP2 with an IC50 of 22.50 μM. Fluorescence titration experiments confirmed that it directly bound to SHP2. Enzymatic kinetic analyses showed that cryptotanshinone was a mixed-type and irreversible inhibitor. This drug was further verified for its ability to block SHP2-mediated cell signaling and cellular functions. Furthermore, mouse myeloid progenitors and patient leukemic cells with the activating mutation E76K in PTPN11 were found to be sensitive to this inhibitor. Since cryptotanshinone is used to treat cardiovascular diseases in Asian countries, this drug has a potential to be used directly or to be further developed to treat PTPN11-associated malignancies.

PTPN11,E76K,"Activating mutations in Ptpn11 (Shp2), a protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in diverse cell signaling pathways, are associated with pediatric leukemias and solid tumors. However, the pathogenic effects of these mutations have not been fully characterized. Here, we report that induction of the Ptpn11(E76K/+) mutation, the most common and active Ptpn11 mutation found in leukemias and solid tumors, in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in proliferative arrest and premature senescence. As a result, apoptosis was markedly increased. These cellular responses were accompanied and mediated by up-regulation of p53 and p21. Moreover, intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), byproducts of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, were elevated in Ptpn11(E76K/+) cells. Since Shp2 is also distributed to the mitochondria (in addition to the cytosol), the impact of the Ptpn11(E76K/+) mutation on mitochondrial function was analyzed. These analyses revealed that oxygen consumption of Ptpn11(E76K/+) cells and the respiratory function of Ptpn11(E76K/+) mitochondria were significantly increased. Furthermore, we found that phosphorylation of mitochondrial Stat3, one of the substrates of Shp2 phosphatase, was greatly decreased in the mutant cells with the activating mutation Ptpn11(E76K/+). This study provides novel insights into the initial effects of tumor-associated Ptpn11 mutations. ",10.1074/jbc.M113.462291
PTPN11,E76K,"Activating mutations in PTPN11 (encoding SHP2), a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that plays an overall positive role in growth factor and cytokine signaling, are directly associated with the pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome and childhood leukemias. Identification of SHP2-selective inhibitors could lead to the development of new drugs that ultimately serve as treatments for PTPN11-associated diseases. As the catalytic core of SHP2 shares extremely high homology to those of SHP1 and other PTPs that play negative roles in cell signaling, to identify selective inhibitors of SHP2 using computer-aided drug design, we targeted a protein surface pocket that is adjacent to the catalytic site, is predicted to be important for binding to phosphopeptide substrates, and has structural features unique to SHP2. From computationally selected candidate compounds, #220-324 effectively inhibited SHP2 activity with an IC50 of 14 μmol/L. Fluorescence titration experiments confirmed its direct binding to SHP2. This active compound was further verified for its ability to inhibit SHP2-mediated cell signaling and cellular function with minimal off-target effects. Furthermore, mouse myeloid progenitors with the activating mutation (E76K) in PTPN11 and patient leukemic cells with the same mutation were more sensitive to this inhibitor than wild-type cells. This study provides evidence that SHP2 is a ""druggable"" target for the treatment of PTPN11-associated diseases. As the small-molecule SHP2 inhibitor identified has a simple chemical structure, it represents an ideal lead compound for the development of novel anti-SHP2 drugs.

PTPN11,E76K,"Gain of function (GOF) mutations in protein tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn11 have been identified in childhood leukemias, and these mutations are sufficient to drive the development of myeloproliferative disorder and malignant leukemias in mice. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Ptpn11 mutations induce these malignancies are not completely understood. Here we report that Ptpn11 GOF mutations cause cytokine hypersensitivity in hematopoietic cells partly by enhancing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). GOF mutations D61G or E76K in Ptpn11 increased ROS levels in myeloid progenitors but not in hematopoietic stem cells. Increased ROS enhanced cellular responses to cytokines by promoting cytokine signaling. Treatment with an antioxidant partially corrected cytokine hypersensitivity in Ptpn11 mutant progenitors. Further analyses demonstrated that Ptpn11 mutations increased mitochondrial aerobic metabolism by interacting with a novel substrate in the mitochondria. This study provides new insights into the pathogenic effects of GOF mutations of Ptpn11 and implies that antioxidants may have a therapeutic benefit for the leukemic patients with these mutations.",10.1371/journal.pone.0063152
PTPN11,E76K,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is an aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm of young children initiated by mutations that deregulate cytokine receptor signaling. Studies of JMML are constrained by limited access to patient tissues. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from malignant cells of two JMML patients with somatic heterozygous p.E76K missense mutations in PTPN11, which encodes SHP-2, a nonreceptor tyrosine phosphatase. In vitro differentiation of JMML iPSCs produced myeloid cells with increased proliferative capacity, constitutive activation of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and enhanced STAT5/ERK phosphorylation, similar to primary JMML cells from patients. Pharmacological inhibition of MEK kinase in iPSC-derived JMML cells reduced their GM-CSF independence, providing rationale for a potential targeted therapy. Our studies offer renewable sources of biologically relevant human cells in which to explore the pathophysiology and treatment of JMML. More generally, we illustrate the utility of iPSCs for in vitro modeling of a human malignancy.",10.1182/blood-2013-01-478412
PTPN11,E76K,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia is a lethal disease of children characterized by hypersensitivity of hematopoietic progenitors to granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor. Mutations in PTPN11, the gene encoding the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2, are common in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and induce hyperactivation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase pathway. We found that genetic disruption of Pik3r1, the gene encoding the Class IA phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunits p85α, p55α and p50α, significantly reduced hyperproliferation and hyperphosphorylation of Akt in gain-of-function Shp2 E76K-expressing cells. Elevated protein levels of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase catalytic subunit, p110δ, in the Shp2 E76K-expressing Pik3r1-/- cells suggest that p110δ may be a crucial mediator of mutant Shp2-induced phosphoinositide-3-kinase hyperactivation. Consistently, treatment with the p110δ-specific inhibitor, IC87114, or the clinical grade pan-phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitor, GDC-0941, reduced granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor hypersensitivity. Treatment with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor, tipifarnib, showed that Shp2 E76K induces hyperactivation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase by both Ras-dependent and Ras-independent mechanisms.

PTPN11,E76K,"Activating mutations in protein tyrosine phosphatase 11 (Ptpn11) have been identified in childhood acute leukemias, in addition to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), which is a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD). It is not clear whether activating mutations of this phosphatase play a causal role in the pathogenesis of acute leukemias. If so, the cell origin of leukemia-initiating stem cells (LSCs) remains to be determined. Ptpn11(E76K) mutation is the most common and most active Ptpn11 mutation found in JMML and acute leukemias. However, the pathogenic effects of this mutation have not been well characterized. We have created Ptpn11(E76K) conditional knock-in mice. Global Ptpn11(E76K/+) mutation results in early embryonic lethality. Induced knock-in of this mutation in pan hematopoietic cells leads to MPD as a result of aberrant activation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and myeloid progenitors. These animals subsequently progress to acute leukemias. Intriguingly, in addition to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) and B-ALL are evolved. Moreover, tissue-specific knock-in of Ptpn11(E76K/+) mutation in lineage-committed myeloid, T lymphoid, and B lymphoid progenitors also results in AML, T-ALL, and B-ALL, respectively. Further analyses have revealed that Shp2 (encoded by Ptpn11) is distributed to centrosomes and that Ptpn11(E76K/+) mutation promotes LSC development, partly by causing centrosome amplification and genomic instability. Thus, Ptpn11(E76K) mutation has non-lineage-specific effects on malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells and initiates acute leukemias at various stages of hematopoiesis.",10.1084/jem.20110450

KSR1 activation and interaction with phospho-Erk was enhanced in Shp2D61Y- and ShpE76K-expressing cells. Genetic disruption of KSR1 partially normalized Shp2E76K-induced GM-CSF hypersensitivity, but failed to correct Shp2D61Y-induced GM-CSF hypersensitivity.

PTPN11,E76K,"The protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) Shp2 (PTPN11) is an attractive target for anticancer drug discovery because it mediates growth factor signaling and its gain-of-function mutants are causally linked to leukemias. We previously synthesized SPI-112 from a lead compound of Shp2 inhibitor, NSC-117199. In this study, we demonstrated that SPI-112 bound to Shp2 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and displayed competitive inhibitor kinetics to Shp2. Like some other compounds in the PTP inhibitor discovery efforts, SPI-112 was not cell permeable, precluding its use in biological studies. To overcome the cell permeation issue, we prepared a methyl ester SPI-112 analog (SPI-112Me) that is predicted to be hydrolyzed to SPI-112 upon entry into cells. Fluorescence uptake assay and confocal imaging suggested that SPI-112Me was taken up by cells. Incubation of cells with SPI-112Me inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated Shp2 PTP activity and Shp2-mediated paxillin dephosphorylation, Erk1/2 activation, and cell migration. SPI-112Me treatment also inhibited Erk1/2 activation by a Gab1-Shp2 chimera. Treatment of Shp2(E76K) mutant-transformed TF-1 myeloid cells with SPI-112Me resulted in inhibition of Shp2(E76K)-dependent cell survival, which is associated with inhibition of Shp2(E76K) PTP activity, Shp2(E76K)-induced Erk1/2 activation, and Bcl-XL expression. Furthermore, SPI-112Me enhanced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-stimulated STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, ISRE-luciferase reporter activity, p21 expression, and the anti-proliferative effect. Thus, the SPI-112 methyl ester analog was able to inhibit cellular Shp2 PTP activity.",10.1016/j.bcp.2010.05.019
PTPN11,E76K,"Mutations in SHP-2 phosphatase (PTPN11) that cause hyperactivation of its catalytic activity have been identified in Noonan syndrome and various childhood leukemias. Recent studies suggest that the gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of SHP-2 play a causal role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms by which GOF mutations of SHP-2 induce these phenotypes are not fully understood. Here, we show that GOF mutations in SHP-2, such as E76K and D61G, drastically increase spreading and migration of various cell types, including hematopoietic cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. More importantly, in vivo angiogenesis in SHP-2 D61G knock-in mice is also enhanced. Mechanistic studies suggest that the increased cell migration is attributed to the enhanced beta1 integrin outside-in signaling. In response to beta1 integrin cross-linking or fibronectin stimulation, activation of ERK and Akt kinases is greatly increased by SHP-2 GOF mutations. Also, integrin-induced activation of RhoA and Rac1 GTPases is elevated. Interestingly, mutant cells with the SHP-2 GOF mutation (D61G) are more sensitive than wild-type cells to the suppression of cell motility by inhibition of these pathways. Collectively, these studies reaffirm the positive role of SHP-2 phosphatase in cell motility and suggest a new mechanism by which SHP-2 GOF mutations contribute to diseases.",10.1074/jbc.M804129200

Myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), either transient or more fulminant forms, can also occur in infants with NS (NS/MPD). We identified PTPN11 mutations in blood or bone marrow specimens from 77 newly reported patients with JMML (n = 69) or NS/MPD (n = 8). Together with previous reports, we compared the spectrum of PTPN11 mutations in 3 groups: (1) patients with JMML (n = 107); (2) patients with NS/MPD (n = 19); and (3) patients with NS (n = 243). Glu76 was the most commonly affected residue in JMML (n = 45), with the Glu76Lys alteration (n = 29) being most frequent. Eight of 19 patients with NS/MPD carried the Thr73Ile substitution. These data suggest that there is a genotype/phenotype correlation in the spectrum of PTPN11 mutations found in patients with JMML, NS/MPD, and NS. This supports the need to characterize the spectrum of hematologic abnormalities in individuals with NS and to better define the impact of the PTPN11 lesion on the disease course in patients with NS/MPD and JMML.",10.1182/blood-2005-02-0531

Somatic PTPN11 mutations were recently identified in about 35% of patients with JMML; these mutations introduce amino acid substitutions that are largely distinct from those found in NS. We assessed the functional consequences of leukemia-associated PTPN11 mutations in murine hematopoietic cells.

E76K SHP-2 expression also enhanced the growth of immature progenitor cells with high replating potential, perturbed erythroid growth, and impaired normal differentiation in liquid cultures. In addition, leukemia-associated SHP-2 mutations conferred a stronger phenotype than a germline mutation found in patients with NS. Mutant SHP-2 proteins induce aberrant growth in multiple hematopoietic compartments, which supports a primary role of hyperactive Ras in the pathogenesis of JMML.",10.1182/blood-2004-11-4207

We hypothesized that PTPN11 mutations induce hypersensitivity of hematopoietic progenitors to GM-CSF and confer increased GM-CSF-stimulated phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) levels. To test this hypothesis, the wild-type (WT) and 3 mutant Ptpn11 cDNAs (E76K, D61V, and D61Y) were transduced into murine bone marrow cells to examine GM-CSF-stimulated granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) growth, macrophage progenitor proliferation, and activation of the Ras signaling pathway. Expression of the Shp-2 mutants induced progenitor cell hypersensitivity to GM-CSF compared with cells transduced with vector alone or WT Shp-2.

PTPN11,E139D,"SHP2/PTPN11 is a key regulator of cytokine, growth factor and integrin signaling. SHP2 influences cell survival, proliferation and differentiation by regulating major signaling pathways. Mutations in PTPN11 cause severe diseases like Noonan, LEOPARD syndrome or leukemia. Whereas several of these mutations result in altered enzymatic activity due to impaired auto-inhibition, not all disease patterns can be explained by this mechanism. In this study we analyzed altered binding properties of disease-related SHP2-mutants bearing point mutations within the SH2-domain (T42A, E139D, and R138Q). Mutants were chosen according to SPR assays, which revealed different binding properties of mutated SH2 towards phosphorylated receptor peptides. To analyze global changes in mutant binding properties we applied quantitative mass spectrometry (SILAC). Using an in vitro approach we identified overall more than 1000 protein candidates, which specifically bind to the SH2-domain of SHP2. We discovered that mutations in the SH2-domain selectively affected protein enrichment by altering the binding capacity of the SH2-domain. Mutation-dependent, enhanced or reduced exposure of SHP2 to its binding partners could have an impact on the dynamics of signaling networks. Thus, disease-associated mutants of SHP2 should not only be discussed in the context of deregulated auto-inhibition but also with respect to deregulated protein targeting of the SHP2 mutants.
Using quantitative mass spectrometry based proteomics we provided evidence that disease related mutations in SHP2 domains of SHP2 are able to influence SHP2 recruitment to its targets in mutation dependent manner. We discovered that mutations in the SH2-domain selectively affected protein enrichment ratios suggesting altered binding properties of the SH2-domain. We demonstrated that mutations within SHP2, which had been attributed to affect the enzymatic activity (i.e. affect the open/close status of SHP2), also differ in respect to binding properties. Our study indicates that SHP2 mutations need to be discussed not only in terms of deregulated auto-inhibition but also with respect to deregulated protein targeting properties of the SHP2 mutants. Discovery of the new binding partners for disease-related SHP2 mutants might provide a fruitful foundation for developing strategies targeting Noonan-associated leukemia.",10.1016/j.jprot.2013.04.005

Molecular genetic analysis of lymphoblastic blasts at the time of the ALL diagnosis revealed the germline mutation in a heterozygous state, while in the myelomonocytic blasts occurring with JMML diagnosis, the mutation p.E139D was found in a homozygous state due to a uniparental disomy (UPD).

PTPN11,E139D,"Missense PTPN11 mutations cause Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes (NS and LS), two developmental disorders with pleiomorphic phenotypes. PTPN11 encodes SHP2, an SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase functioning as a signal transducer. Generally, different substitutions of a particular amino acid residue are observed in these diseases, indicating that the crucial factor is the residue being replaced. For a few codons, only one substitution is observed, suggesting the possibility of specific roles for the residue introduced. We analyzed the biochemical behavior and ligand-binding properties of all possible substitutions arising from single-base changes affecting codons 42, 139, 279, 282 and 468 to investigate the mechanisms underlying the invariant occurrence of the T42A, E139D and I282V substitutions in NS and the Y279C and T468M changes in LS. Our data demonstrate that the isoleucine-to-valine change at codon 282 is the only substitution at that position perturbing the stability of SHP2's closed conformation without impairing catalysis, while the threonine-to-alanine change at codon 42, but not other substitutions of that residue, promotes increased phosphopeptide-binding affinity.

Phenotype overlap complicates clinical discrimination within RASopathies, making the diagnosis of LEOPARD more confusing and challenging. Besides, LEOPARD patients do not usually present with all these typical clinical features, increasing the possibility of underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis.Herein, we report a case of LEOPARD syndrome in a patient who only presented with pigmented skin spots and was initially diagnosed with multiple acquired melanocytic nevi. Subsequent pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of multiple lentigines rather than melanocytic nevi. A genetic study showed a germline PTPN11 (Tyr279Cys) mutation and raised the suspicion of LEOPARD syndrome. A subsequent ECG examination detected potential cardiac defects and confirmed the diagnosis of LEOPARD. We considered that the potential damage of other systems underlying the skin multiple lentigines should not be ignored. The diagnosis of LEOPARD syndrome in an early stage before cardiac damage has reached a serious and irreversible stage can be meaningful for patients to fully understand the potential risks, complications and prognosis of the disease and to take appropriate precautions to prevent the potential risk of cardiac damage.",10.1186/s41065-021-00199-5
PTPN11,Y279C,"Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML) is an autosomal dominant disorder presenting with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Up to 85% of NSML cases are caused by mutations in the PTPN11 gene that encodes for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2). We previously showed that low-dose dasatinib protects from the development of cardiac fibrosis in a mouse model of NSML harboring a Ptpn11
Dasatinib was administered intraperitoneally into NSML mice with doses ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg. PK parameters of dasatinib in NSML mice were determined. PD parameters were obtained for biochemical analyses from heart tissue. Dasatinib-treated NSML mice (0.1 mg/kg) were subjected to echocardiography and assessment of markers of HCM by qRT-PCR. Transcriptome analysis was performed from the heart tissue of low-dose dasatinib-treated mice.
Low-dose dasatinib exhibited PK properties that were linear across doses in NSML mice. Dasatinib treatment of between 0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg in NSML mice yielded an exposure-dependent inhibition of c-Src and PZR tyrosyl phosphorylation and inhibited AKT phosphorylation. We found that doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg of dasatinib prevented HCM in NSML mice. Transcriptome analysis identified differentially expressed HCM-associated genes in the heart of NSML mice that were reverted to wild type levels by low-dose dasatinib administration.
These data demonstrate that low-dose dasatinib exhibits desirable therapeutic PK properties that is sufficient for effective target engagement to ameliorate HCM progression in NSML mice. These data demonstrate that low-dose dasatinib treatment may be an effective therapy against HCM in NSML patients.",10.1007/s10557-021-07169-z

In the present study, mTOR pathway activity was examined in human myocardial samples from two patients with LS, four patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and four normal controls. The two patients with LS had p.Y279C and p.T468 M mutations of the PTPN11 gene, respectively. Although PTPN11 mutation showed initially positive regulation on phosphoinositide 3-kinase, overall the mTOR complex 1 pathway showed widely attenuated activity in LS. This included mildly hypophosphorylated mTOR and ribosomal protein S6 kinase and significantly hypophosphorylated Akt
In LS, the mTOR signaling pathway shows similar activity to HCM and is attenuated compared with normal controls. Thus, caution should be applied when using rapamycin to treat heart hypertrophy in LS.",10.1186/s13023-019-1204-4

PTPN11,Y279C,"Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines (NSML, formerly LEOPARD syndrome) is an autosomal dominant ""RASopathy"" disorder manifesting in congenital heart disease. Most cases of NSML are caused by catalytically inactivating mutations in the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11), encoding the SH2 domain-containing PTP-2 (SHP2) protein. We previously generated knock-in mice harboring the PTPN11 mutation Y279C, one of the most common NSML alleles; these now-termed SHP2Y279C/+ mice recapitulate the human disorder and develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) by 12 weeks of age. Functionally, heart and/or cardiomyocyte lysates from SHP2Y279C/+ mice exhibit increased basal and agonist-induced AKT and mTOR activities. Here, we sought to determine whether we could reverse the hypertrophy in SHP2Y279C/+ mice using ARQ 092, an oral and selective allosteric AKT inhibitor currently in clinical trials for patients with PI3K/AKT-driven tumors or Proteus syndrome. We obtained echocardiographs of SHP2Y279C/+ and wildtype (SHP2+/+) littermates, either in the presence or absence of ARQ 092 at 12, 14, and 16 weeks of age. While SHP2Y279C/+ mice developed significant left ventricular hypertrophy by 12 weeks, as indicated by decreased chamber dimension and increased posterior wall thickness, treatment of SHP2Y279C/+ mice with ARQ 092 normalized the hypertrophy in as early as 2 weeks following treatment, with hearts comparable in size to those in wildtype (SHP2+/+) mice. In addition, we observed an increase in fractional shortening (FS%) in SHP2Y279C/+ mice, an effect of increased compensatory hypertrophy, which was not apparent in SHP2Y279C/+ mice treated with ARQ 092, suggesting functional improvement of HCM upon treatment with the AKT inhibitor. Finally, we found that ARQ 092 specifically inhibited AKT activity, as well as its downstream effectors, PRAS and S6RP in NSML mice. Taken together, these data suggest ARQ 092 may be a promising novel therapy for treatment of hypertrophy in NSML patients.",10.1371/journal.pone.0178905

In this study, twenty Noonan syndrome patients with PTPN11 mutations were included. The patients underwent a detailed clinical and physical evaluation. To identify inherited cases, parents of all mutation positive patients were analyzed.
Thirteen different PTPN11 mutations, two of them being novel, were detected in the study group. These mutations included eleven missense mutations: p.G60A, p.D61N, p.Y62D, p.Y63C, p.E69Q, p.Q79R, p.Y279C,p.N308D, p.N308S, p.M504V, p.Q510R and two novel missense mutations: p.I56V and p.I282M.

PTPN11,Y279C,"SHP2, encoded by the PTPN11 gene, is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a key role in the proliferation of cells via RAS-ERK activation. SHP2 also promotes Wnt signaling by dephosphorylating parafibromin. Germline missense mutations of PTPN11 are found in more than half of patients with Noonan syndrome (NS) and LEOPARD syndrome (LS), both of which are congenital developmental disorders with multiple common symptoms. However, whereas NS-associated PTPN11 mutations give rise to gain-of-function SHP2 mutants, LS-associated SHP2 mutants are reportedly loss-of-function mutants. To determine the phosphatase activity of LS-associated SHP2 more appropriately, we performed an in vitro phosphatase assay using tyrosine-phosphorylated parafibromin, a biologically relevant substrate of SHP2 and the positive regulator of Wnt signaling that is activated through SHP2-mediated dephosphorylation. We found that LS-associated SHP2 mutants (Y279C, T468M, Q506P, and Q510E) exhibited a substantially reduced phosphatase activity toward parafibromin when compared with wild-type SHP2. Furthermore, each of the LS-associated mutants displayed a differential degree of decrease in phosphatase activity. Deviation of the SHP2 catalytic activity from a certain range, either too strong or too weak, may therefore lead to similar clinical outcomes in NS and LS, possibly through an imbalanced Wnt signal caused by inadequate dephosphorylation of parafibromin.",10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.12.117

To elucidate the pathogenesis of multiple lentigines in LS, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analyses of lentigines and non-lesional skin were performed. Numerous mature giant melanosomes in melanocytes and keratinocytes were observed in lentigines. In addition, the levels of expression of endothelin-1 (ET-1), phosphorylated Akt, mTOR and STAT3 in the epidermis in lentigines were significantly elevated compared with non-lesional skin. In in vitro assays, melanin synthesis in human melanoma cells expressing SHP-2 with LS-associated mutations was higher than in cells expressing normal SHP-2, suggesting that LS-associated SHP-2 mutations might enhance melanin synthesis in melanocytes, and that the activation of Akt/mTOR signalling may contribute to this process.

LEOPARD is an acronym, mnemonic for the major manifestations of this disorder, characterized by multiple lentigines, electrocardiographic abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonic stenosis, abnormal genitalia, retardation of growth, and sensorineural deafness. Though it is not included in the acronym, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most frequent cardiac anomaly observed, representing a potentially life-threatening problem in these patients.

In approximately 85% of the patients with a definite diagnosis of LS, a missense mutation is found in the protein-tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11) gene located on chromosome 12q24.1. We report the case of an asymptomatic 17-year-old male with a missense mutation (c.836A>G) in exon 7 (Tyr279Cys) of the PTPN11 gene and a non-obstructive asymmetric anteroseptal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",10.1159/000335995

RASopathies typically affect components of the RAS/MAPK pathway, yet it remains unclear how PTPN11 mutations alter cellular signaling to produce LS phenotypes. We therefore generated knockin mice harboring the Ptpn11 mutation Y279C, one of the most common LS alleles. Ptpn11(Y279C/+) (LS/+) mice recapitulated the human disorder, with short stature, craniofacial dysmorphia, and morphologic, histologic, echocardiographic, and molecular evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Heart and/or cardiomyocyte lysates from LS/+ mice showed enhanced binding of Shp2 to Irs1, decreased Shp2 catalytic activity, and abrogated agonist-evoked Erk/Mapk signaling. LS/+ mice also exhibited increased basal and agonist-induced Akt and mTor activity. The cardiac defects in LS/+ mice were completely reversed by treatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR.

As clinical manifestations are variable, molecular testing is supportive in the diagnosis of LS. We describe two unrelated LS cases with a common PTPN11 mutation Y279C and with completely different clinical features including distinct changes in skin pigmentation. In patient 1, the first complaint was hyperactive behaviour. First lentigines were presented at birth, but intensive growth began at the age of 2-4 years. Multiple dark lentigines were located mainly on the face and the upper part of the trunk, but the oral mucosa was spared. Patient 2 was born from induced labour due to polyhydramnion, and in the second week of life, mitral valve insufficiency and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were diagnosed. Rapid growth of lentigines began at the age of 3 years. These are mostly located in the joint areas in the lower extremities; the face and upper trunk are spared from lentigines. In both cases, the rapid growth of lentigines made it possible to shift the diagnosis towards LS.

PTPN11,Y279C,"Missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, cause clinically similar but distinctive disorders, LEOPARD (LS) and Noonan (NS) syndromes. The LS is an autosomal dominant disorder with pleomorphic developmental abnormalities including lentigines, cardiac defects, short stature and deafness. Biochemical analyses indicated that LS alleles engender loss-of-function (LOF) effects, while NS mutations result in gain-of-function (GOF). These biochemical findings lead to an enigma that how PTPN11 mutations with opposite effects on function result in disorders that are so similar. To study the developmental effects of the commonest LS PTPN11 alleles (Y279C and T468M), we generated LS transgenic fruitflies using corkscrew (csw), the Drosophila orthologue of PTPN11. Ubiquitous expression of the LS csw mutant alleles resulted in ectopic wing veins and, for the Y279C allele, rough eyes with increased R7 photoreceptor numbers. These were GOF phenotypes mediated by increased RAS/MAPK signaling and requiring the LS mutant's residual phosphatase activity.

For a few codons, only one substitution is observed, suggesting the possibility of specific roles for the residue introduced. We analyzed the biochemical behavior and ligand-binding properties of all possible substitutions arising from single-base changes affecting codons 42, 139, 279, 282 and 468 to investigate the mechanisms underlying the invariant occurrence of the T42A, E139D and I282V substitutions in NS and the Y279C and T468M changes in LS. Our data demonstrate that the isoleucine-to-valine change at codon 282 is the only substitution at that position perturbing the stability of SHP2's closed conformation without impairing catalysis, while the threonine-to-alanine change at codon 42, but not other substitutions of that residue, promotes increased phosphopeptide-binding affinity. The recognition specificity of the C-SH2 domain bearing the E139D substitution differed substantially from its wild-type counterpart acquiring binding properties similar to those observed for the N-SH2 domain, revealing a novel mechanism of SHP2's functional dysregulation.

To test this model, we investigated further the diversity of germline and somatic PTPN11 mutations, delineated the association of those mutations with disease, characterized biochemically a panel of mutant SHP-2 proteins recurring in NS, LS, and leukemia, and performed molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural effects of selected mutations. Our results document a strict correlation between the identity of the lesion and disease and demonstrate that NS-causative mutations have less potency for promoting SHP-2 gain of function than do leukemia-associated ones.

Although genetic heterogeneity of LEOPARD and nonsyndromic HCM is not disputed, the existence of peculiar interactions linking genes causing nonsyndromic HCM and HCM in LEOPARD syndrome can be hypothesized.

Changes at amino acids 501 to 504 cause NS. Gln506Pro is predicted, by modeling analysis, to seriously disrupt the normal contacts between the regulating N-SH2 and the active PTP domains, leading to hyperactivity of the phosphatase.

Genetic screening of 91 children with short stature of unknown etiology was performed with the help of the NGS panel. All the coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of 166 genes were included in the panel. To clarify the pathogenicity of these mutations, their clinical data were reviewed and analyzed.
The assay identified p.A72G, p.I282V, and p.P491S variants of the PTPN11 gene and a p.I437T variant of the SOS1 gene in 4 cases with Noonan syndrome. A frameshift mutation (p.D2407fs) of the ACAN gene was identified in a case of idiopathic short stature with moderately advanced bone age. A p.R904C variant of the COL2A1 gene was found in a patient, who was accordingly diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Severe short stature without limb deformity was associated with a p.G11A variant of HOXD13. In addition, we evaluated evidence that a p.D401N variant of the COMP gene may cause multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.
Our findings suggest that syndromes, particularly Noonan syndrome, may be overlooked due to atypical clinical features. This gene panel has been verified to be effective for the rapid screening of genetic etiologies associated with short stature and for guiding precision medicine-based clinical management.",10.1186/s12881-018-0730-6
PTPN11,I282V,"Missense PTPN11 mutations cause Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes (NS and LS), two developmental disorders with pleiomorphic phenotypes. PTPN11 encodes SHP2, an SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase functioning as a signal transducer. Generally, different substitutions of a particular amino acid residue are observed in these diseases, indicating that the crucial factor is the residue being replaced. For a few codons, only one substitution is observed, suggesting the possibility of specific roles for the residue introduced. We analyzed the biochemical behavior and ligand-binding properties of all possible substitutions arising from single-base changes affecting codons 42, 139, 279, 282 and 468 to investigate the mechanisms underlying the invariant occurrence of the T42A, E139D and I282V substitutions in NS and the Y279C and T468M changes in LS. Our data demonstrate that the isoleucine-to-valine change at codon 282 is the only substitution at that position perturbing the stability of SHP2's closed conformation without impairing catalysis, while the threonine-to-alanine change at codon 42, but not other substitutions of that residue, promotes increased phosphopeptide-binding affinity. The recognition specificity of the C-SH2 domain bearing the E139D substitution differed substantially from its wild-type counterpart acquiring binding properties similar to those observed for the N-SH2 domain, revealing a novel mechanism of SHP2's functional dysregulation. Finally, while functional selection does not seem to occur for the substitutions at codons 279 and 468, we point to deamination of the methylated cytosine at nucleotide 1403 as the driving factor leading to the high prevalence of the T468M change in LS.",10.1093/hmg/ddn099
PTPN11,N308D,"Most commonly used behavioral measures for testing learning and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) involve comparisons of an animal's residence time in different quadrants of the pool. Such measures are limited in their ability to test different aspects of the animal's performance. Here, we describe novel measures of performance in the MWM that use vector fields to capture the motion of mice as well as their search pattern in the maze. Using these vector fields, we develop quantitative measures of performance that are intuitive and more sensitive than classical measures. First, we describe search patterns in terms of vector field properties and use these properties to define three metrics of spatial memory namely Spatial Accuracy, Uncertainty and, Intensity of Search. We demonstrate the usefulness of these measures using four different data sets including comparisons between different strains of mice, an analysis of two mouse models of Noonan syndrome (NS; Ptpn11 D61G and Ptpn11 N308D/+), and a study of goal reversal training. Importantly, besides highlighting novel aspects of performance in this widely used spatial task, our measures were able to uncover previously undetected differences, including in an animal model of NS, which we rescued with the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor SL327. Thus, our results show that our approach breaks down performance in the MWM into sensitive measurable independent components that highlight differences in spatial learning and memory in the MWM that were undetected by conventional measures.",10.1002/hipo.23404

A 5-year-and-9-month-old 46, XX girl born SGA was started on GH treatment at a dose of 0.32 mg/kg/week. Her midparental target height is 158.6 cm. Endocrine work up showed an IGF-1 level 69 ng/ml (Normal (N): 55-238 ng/ml), IGFBP3 2.6 mg/L (N: 1.9-5.2 mg/L), TSH 3.2 mIU/L (N: 0.35-5.5 mIU/L), and a normal skeletal survey. Height was 96 cm (0.1%; Ht SDS -2.9), weight 14 kgs (1%; Wt SDS -2.3), and Tanner 1 breast and pubic hair were observed. Due to the poor catch-up growth on GH treatment, she was referred to Genetics to elucidate genetic or syndromic causes of short stature. She was noted to have posteriorly rotated ears and slight down slanting of the palpebral fissures. Genetic findings showed a heterozygous pathogenic variant in

We report the clinical description of a young adult male presenting with relapsing ganglioneuromas, dysmorphic features, cardiac abnormalities, and multiple lentigines, strongly suspicious for NS. Solid tumor testing identified the recurrent pathogenic c.922G>A (p.Asn308Asp) in PTPN11. Proband and parental blood sampling testing confirmed c.922G>A as a de novo germline alteration. Comprehensive literature review of solid tumors specifically associated to PTPN11, indicates that this is the first documentation of ganglioneuroma and its clinical recurrence after resection in conjunction with a genetically confirmed NS diagnosis.

Lymphedema and chylous pleural effusions are common in Noonan syndrome, but protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) has only rarely been described in the condition and little is known about its genetic associations.
We report the case of a 30-year-old Chinese woman who developed severe recurrent edema and hypoproteinemia. Gastroduodenoscopy showed a ""snowflake"" appearance of lymphangiectasia in the duodenum, and CT reconstruction of the small intestine showed segmental thickening of the intestinal wall with localized stenosis. Whole exome sequencing revealed that the patient harbored a pathogenic variant of PTPN11 (c.A922G p.N308D), which was unfortunately inherited by her 2.5-year-old daughter who had short stature and atrial septal defect but no hypoproteinemia.
This case of Noonan syndrome with PLE was associated with a PTPN11 mutation. A comprehensive review of PLE in Noonan syndrome revealed that PLE often presents late in this context but there is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation.

A molecular diagnosis is a key factor.
To identify PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, BRAF, and HRAS mutations and compare the main clinical characteristics of patients with molecular confirmation. Population and methods. Children with a clinical diagnosis of RASopathy assessed between August 2013 and February 2017.
Mutations were identified in 71 % (87/122) of patients. The molecular test confirmed diagnosis in 73 % of patients with Noonan syndrome. The most prevalent mutation was c.922A>G (p.Asn308Asp) in the PTPN11 gene. A previously undescribed variant in RAF1 was detected: c.1467G>>C (p.Leu489Phe). Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome was confirmed in 67 % of cases with BRAF mutations. Costello syndrome and Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines were confirmed in all cases.

NS is one of the most common genetic disorders associated with congenital heart disease, and approximately half of the patients with Noonan syndrome have gain-of-function mutations in SHP2. One of the most common NS mutations is N308D. The activity of SHP2, like that of most PTPs, is reversibly inactivated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the molecular basis of this inactivation and the consequences of NS-related mutations in PTPN11 on ROS-mediated inhibition are poorly understood.

PTPN11,N308D,"Noonan Syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder with many variable and heterogeneous conditions. The genetic basis for 20-30% of cases is still unknown. This study evaluates Iranian Noonan patients both clinically and genetically for the first time.
Mutational analysis of PTPN11 gene was performed in 15 Iranian patients, using PCR and Sanger sequencing at phase one. Then, as phase two, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in the form of targeted resequencing was utilized for analysis of exons from other related genes. Homology modelling for the novel founded mutations was performed as well. The genotype, phenotype correlation was done according to the molecular findings and clinical features.
Previously reported mutation (p.N308D) in some patients and a novel mutation (p.D155N) in one of the patients were identified in phase one. After applying NGS methods, known and new variants were found in four patients in other genes, including: CBL (p. V904I), KRAS (p. L53W), SOS1 (p. I1302V), and SOS1 (p. R552G). Structural studies of two deduced novel mutations in related genes revealed deficiencies in the mutated proteins. Following genotype, phenotype correlation, a new pattern of the presence of intellectual disability in two patients was registered.

In this study, twenty Noonan syndrome patients with PTPN11 mutations were included. The patients underwent a detailed clinical and physical evaluation. To identify inherited cases, parents of all mutation positive patients were analyzed.
Thirteen different PTPN11 mutations, two of them being novel, were detected in the study group. These mutations included eleven missense mutations: p.G60A, p.D61N, p.Y62D, p.Y63C, p.E69Q, p.Q79R, p.Y279C,p.N308D, p.N308S, p.M504V, p.Q510R and two novel missense mutations: p.I56V and p.I282M.

PTPN11,N308D,"Noonan syndrome (NS) and other syndromes with a similar phenotype, such as LEOPARD, cardiofaciocutaneous, Costello and Legius, are associated to mutations in genes included in the RAS/MAPK pathway (RASopathies), which is an important signalling pathway related to cell proliferation. Tonsillar descent into the upper cervical spinal canal, known as Arnold-Chiari malformation (ACM), has been reported in patients with NS and this has led some researchers to suggest that ACM could be part of the phenotypic spectrum of NS. We report two cases of NS and ACM.
Case 1: 29-year-old female with Noonan phenotype who underwent surgery at the age of nine years due to pulmonary valve stenosis. At the age of 27, she presented symptomatic ACM that required surgical decompression. She presented the c.922A>G (N308D) mutation in the gene PTPN that belongs to the RAS/MAPK pathway. Case 2: a 10-year-old female with Noonan phenotype and asymptomatic ACM detected in magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. She was a carrier of the c.923A>G (N308S) mutation in gene PTPN11.
Six patients with this association have been found in the literature, four with the Noonan phenotype and two with LEOPARD. Our two patients provide supplementary evidence that backs up the hypothesis by which ACM would be part of the phenotypic spectrum of NS. The small number of reported cases of patients with this association does not allow us to draw up recommendations about when and how often neuroimaging studies should be performed; a careful neurological examination, however, should be included in the anticipatory health guidelines in syndromes involving the RAS/MAPK pathway.

Introduccion. El sindrome de Noonan (SN) y otros sindromes con fenotipo similar, como LEOPARD, cardiofaciocutaneo, Costello y Legius, estan asociados a mutaciones en genes incluidos en la via RAS/MAPK (rasopatias), una importante via de señalizacion relacionada con la proliferacion celular. El descenso de las amigdalas cerebelares dentro del canal medular cervical, conocido como malformacion de Arnold-Chiari (MAC), se ha descrito en pacientes afectos de SN, lo que ha llevado a sugerir que la MAC podria formar parte del espectro fenotipico del SN. Presentamos dos casos con SN y MAC. Casos clinicos. Caso 1: mujer de 29 años con fenotipo de Noonan. Fue intervenida a los 9 años de estenosis valvular pulmonar.

PTPN11,N308D,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 and Noonan syndrome are both common genetic disorders with autosomal dominant inheritance. Similarities between neurofibromatosis type 1 and Noonan syndrome have been noted for over 20 years and patients who share symptoms of both conditions are often given the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS). The molecular basis of these combined phenotypes was poorly understood and controversially discussed over several decades until the discovery that the syndromes are related through disturbances of the Ras pathway. We present an infant male with coarse facial features, severe supravalvar pulmonic stenosis, automated atrial tachycardia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, airway compression, severe neurological involvement, and multiple complications that lead to death during early infancy. The severity of clinical presentation and significant dysmorphic features suggested the possibility of a double genetic disorder in the Ras pathway instead of NFNS. Molecular analysis showed a missense mutation in exon 25 of the NF1 gene (4288A>G, p.N1430D) and a pathogenic mutation on exon 8 (922A>G, p.N308D) of the PTPN11 gene. Cardiovascular disease has been well described in patients with Noonan syndrome with PTPN11 mutations but the role of haploinsufficiency for neurofibromin in the heart development and function is not yet well understood.

The objective of this study was to report a patient with Noonan syndrome presenting mutations in two genes of RAS/MAPK pathway in order to establish whether these mutations lead to a more severe expression of the phenotype. We used direct sequencing of the PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, and KRAS genes. We have identified two described mutations in heterozygosity: p.N308D and p.R552G in the genes PTPN11 and SOS1, respectively. The patient has typical clinical features similar to the ones with NS and mutation in only one gene, even those with the same mutation identified in this patient.

Two patients show mutations in PTPN11 (p.Tyr62Asp and p.Asn308Asp) and three in SOS1 (p.Arg552Ser and p.Arg552Thr). The latter are the first SOS1 mutations reported outside PTPN11 in NL/MGCL syndrome. MGCL lesions were observed in jaws ('cherubism') and joints ('pigmented villonodular synovitis'). We show through those patients that both types of MGCL are not PTPN11-specific, but rather represent a low penetrant (or perhaps overlooked) complication of the dysregulated RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. We recommend discarding NL/MGCL syndrome from the nosology, as this presentation is neither gene-nor allele-specific of Noonan syndrome; these patients should be described as Noonan syndrome with MGCL (of the mandible, the long bone...). The term cherubism should be used only when multiple giant cell lesions occur without any other clinical and molecular evidence of Noonan syndrome, with or without mutations of the SH3BP2 gene.",10.1038/ejhg.2009.44
PTPN11,N308D,"Mutations in genes coding for transducers participating in the RAS/MAPK pathway have been identified as the molecular cause underlying a group of clinically related developmental disorders with cognitive deficits of variable severity. To determine the spectrum of cognitive defects associated with dysregulation of this signal cascade, we studied the profile of cognitive abilities in patients with mutations affecting the PTPN11, SOS1, HRAS, KRAS, BRAF, RAF1, and MEK1 genes and phenotype-genotype correlations. Our findings support the observation that heterogeneity in cognitive abilities can be at least partially ascribed to the individual affected genes and type of mutation involved. While mutations affecting transducers upstream of RAS were less frequently associated with mental retardation, mutations in downstream components of the pathway were generally associated with a more severe cognitive impairment. Among patients with a heterozygous PTPN11 mutation, the T468M substitution was associated with a mean IQ significantly higher compared to that of individuals carrying the N308D change.

Recent gene discoveries have laid the groundwork for exploring whether variability in the NS phenotype is related to differences at the genetic level. In this study, we examine the influence of both genotype and nongenotypic factors on cognitive functioning. Data are presented from 65 individuals with NS (ages 4-18) who were evaluated using standardized measures of intellectual functioning. The cohort included 33 individuals with PTPN11 mutations, 6 individuals with SOS1 mutations, 1 individual with a BRAF mutation and 25 participants with negative, incomplete or no genetic testing. Results indicate that genotype differences may account for some of the variation in cognitive ability in NS. Whereas cognitive impairments were common among individuals with PTPN11 mutations and those with unknown mutations, all of the individuals with SOS1 mutations exhibited verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills in the average range or higher. Participants with N308D and N308S mutations in PTPN11 also showed no (or mild) cognitive delays. Additional influences such as hearing loss, motor dexterity and parental education levels accounted for significant variability in cognitive outcomes. Severity of cardiac disease was not related to cognitive functioning.

PTPN11,N308D,"Mutations in the PTPN11 gene, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, causes Noonan syndrome (NS), an autosomal dominant disorder with pleomorphic developmental abnormalities. Certain germline and somatic PTPN11 mutations cause leukemias. Mutations have gain-of-function (GOF) effects with the commonest NS allele, N308D, being weaker than the leukemia-causing mutations. To study the effects of disease-associated PTPN11 alleles, we generated transgenic fruitflies with GAL4-inducible expression of wild-type or mutant csw, the Drosophila orthologue of PTPN11. All three transgenic mutant CSWs rescued a hypomorphic csw allele's eye phenotype, documenting activity. Ubiquitous expression of two strong csw mutant alleles were lethal, but did not perturb development from some CSW-dependent receptor tyrosine kinase pathways. Ubiquitous expression of the weaker N308D allele caused ectopic wing veins, identical to the EGFR GOF phenotype. Epistatic analyses established that csw(N308D)'s ectopic wing vein phenotype required intact EGF ligand and receptor, and that this transgene interacted genetically with Notch, DPP and JAK/STAT signaling. Expression of the mutant csw transgenes increased RAS-MAP kinase activation, which was necessary but not sufficient for transducing their phenotypes. The findings from these fly models provided hypotheses testable in mammalian models, in which these signaling cassettes are largely conserved. In addition, these fly models can be used for sensitized screens to identify novel interacting genes as well as for high-throughput screening of therapeutic compounds for NS and PTPN11-related cancers.",10.1093/hmg/ddi471

In this study, PTPN11 mutation analysis was performed in 170 NS patients. In 76 (45%) of them a mutation was identified. We report on the distribution of these mutations, as well as on genotype-phenotype relationships. The benefit of the NS scoring system developed by van der Burgt et al.

In two patients with some uncommon manifestations mutations were found in the C-SH2 domain, a region in which defects are not often identified in NS. A trend was observed in patients carrying the 922A --> G change (Asn308Asp) receiving normal education. In one patient with NS and mild juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) the mutation 218C --> T (Thr73Ile) was found.

To further explore the relevance of PTPN11 mutations to the pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome, we analyzed the PTPN11 gene in 21 Japanese patients. Mutation analysis of the 15 coding exons and their flanking introns by denaturing HPLC and direct sequencing revealed six different heterozygous missense mutations (Asp61Gly, Tyr63Cys, Ala72Ser, Thr73Ile, Phe285Ser, and Asn308Asp) in seven cases (six sporadic and one familial). The mutations clustered either in the N-Src homology 2 domain or in the protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain. The clinical features of the mutation-positive and mutation-negative patients were comparable.

PTPN11,T468M,"Pathogenic mutations in genes (SASH1 and PTPN11) can cause a rare genetic disorder associated with pigmentation defects and the well-known LEOPARD syndrome, respectively. Both conditions presented with lentiginous phenotypes. The aim of this study was to arrive at definite diagnoses of three Chinese boys with clinically suspected lentigines-related syndromes. ADAR1, ABCB6, SASH1 and PTPN11 were candidate genes for mutational screening. Sanger sequencing was performed to identify the mutations, whereas bioinformatic analysis was used to predict the pathogenicity of novel missense mutations. Two novel mutations c.1537A>C (p.Ser513Arg) and 1527_1530dupAAGT (p.Leu511Lysfs*21) in SASH1 and a common p.Thr468Met mutation in PTPN11 were detected in three pediatric patients with lentiginous phenotypes, respectively. Comparisons between clinical presentations showed that SASH1-related phenotypes can exhibit hyper- and hypopigmentation on the trunk and extremities, similar to dyschromatosis, while scattered café au-lait spots usually appeared in PTPN11-related LEOPARD syndrome. Furthermore, the similarity in the clinical presentations of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Laugier-Hunziker syndrome, xeroderma pigmentosum, neurofibromatosis type I, suggesting that these conditions should be added into the differential diagnoses of lentiginous phenotypes.",10.1111/cge.12728
PTPN11,T468M,"LEOPARD syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder primarily caused by mutations in the PTPN11, RAF1 and BRAF genes. Characteristic features include lentigines, craniofacial dysmorphism, myocardium or valve abnormalities, eletrocardiographic conduction defects and deafness. LS, neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome and Legius syndrome are a group of highly overlapped disorders termed 'RASopathies'. Therefore, clinical discrimination between these syndromes represents a huge challenge. The present study reports a young child diagnosed with LS via identification of a common p.Thr468Met mutation in PTPN11. Taking into account two Taiwanese LS cases with an identical mutation, Thr468Met is likely to be the most prevalent mutation in the Chinese population. Furthermore, this study suggests that a clinical diagnosis of LS should be considered for individuals with congenital cardiac defects and atypical lentigines (i.e., light brown freckles) scattered particularly on the face.

PTPN11,T468M,"A patient with Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML) and multiple giant cell lesions (MGCL) in mandibles and maxillae is described. A mutation p.Thr468Met in the PTPN11-gene was found. This is the second reported NSML patient with MGCL. Our case adds to the assumption that, despite a different molecular pathogenesis and effect on the RAS/MEK pathway, NSML shares the development of MGCL, with other RASopathies.

PTPN11,T468M,"RASopathies comprise several genetic syndromes with mainly cardio-facial-cutaneous manifestations. We report a patient with Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML) due to a PTPN11 (p.Thr468Met) mutation associated with hypertrophic neuropathy of lumbar plexus in an adult woman, initially referred for neuropathic pain.

PTPN11,T468M,"SHP2, encoded by the PTPN11 gene, is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a key role in the proliferation of cells via RAS-ERK activation. SHP2 also promotes Wnt signaling by dephosphorylating parafibromin. Germline missense mutations of PTPN11 are found in more than half of patients with Noonan syndrome (NS) and LEOPARD syndrome (LS), both of which are congenital developmental disorders with multiple common symptoms. However, whereas NS-associated PTPN11 mutations give rise to gain-of-function SHP2 mutants, LS-associated SHP2 mutants are reportedly loss-of-function mutants. To determine the phosphatase activity of LS-associated SHP2 more appropriately, we performed an in vitro phosphatase assay using tyrosine-phosphorylated parafibromin, a biologically relevant substrate of SHP2 and the positive regulator of Wnt signaling that is activated through SHP2-mediated dephosphorylation. We found that LS-associated SHP2 mutants (Y279C, T468M, Q506P, and Q510E) exhibited a substantially reduced phosphatase activity toward parafibromin when compared with wild-type SHP2. Furthermore, each of the LS-associated mutants displayed a differential degree of decrease in phosphatase activity. Deviation of the SHP2 catalytic activity from a certain range, either too strong or too weak, may therefore lead to similar clinical outcomes in NS and LS, possibly through an imbalanced Wnt signal caused by inadequate dephosphorylation of parafibromin.",10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.12.117
PTPN11,T468M,"Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML), formerly known as LEOPARD syndrome, is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterised by lentigines, EKG abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonic stenosis, abnormal genitalia, growth retardation and deafness. There is significant clinical overlap between NSML and other disorders that result from dysregulated rat sarcoma/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (RASopathies). Except for neurofibromatosis type 1, other RASopathies are not known to be typically associated with neurogenic tumours.
We evaluated patients from three families with pigmentary skin lesions, progressive neuropathy, enlarged nerves, massive burden of paraspinal tumours (neurofibroma was confirmed in one patient) and a clinical diagnosis of NSML. All patients had a mutation in the protein tyrosine phosphatase catalytic domain of the PTPN11 gene; two unrelated patients had the p.Thr468Met mutation, while the family consisting of two affected individuals harboured the p.Thr279Cys mutation. Molecular analysis performed on hypertrophic nerve tissue did not disclose a second somatic hit in NF1, PTPN11, NF2 or SMARCB1 genes.
Neurogenic tumours and hypertrophic neuropathy are unusual complications of NSML and may be an under-recognised manifestation that would warrant surveillance. Our observation may also have implications for other disorders caused by RAS-pathway dysregulation.",10.1136/jmedgenet-2015-103177
PTPN11,T468M,"LEOPARD syndrome (multiple Lentigines, Electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities, Ocular hypertelorism, Pulmonary stenosis, Abnormal genitalia, Retardation of growth, sensorineural Deafness; LS), also called Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML), is a rare autosomal dominant disorder associating various developmental defects, notably cardiopathies, dysmorphism, and short stature. It is mainly caused by mutations of the PTPN11 gene that catalytically inactivate the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (Src-homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2). Besides its pleiotropic roles during development, SHP2 plays key functions in energetic metabolism regulation. However, the metabolic outcomes of LS mutations have never been examined. Therefore, we performed an extensive metabolic exploration of an original LS mouse model, expressing the T468M mutation of SHP2, frequently borne by LS patients. Our results reveal that, besides expected symptoms, LS animals display a strong reduction of adiposity and resistance to diet-induced obesity, associated with overall better metabolic profile. We provide evidence that LS mutant expression impairs adipogenesis, triggers energy expenditure, and enhances insulin signaling, three features that can contribute to the lean phenotype of LS mice. Interestingly, chronic treatment of LS mice with low doses of MEK inhibitor, but not rapamycin, resulted in weight and adiposity gains. Importantly, preliminary data in a French cohort of LS patients suggests that most of them have lower-than-average body mass index, associated, for tested patients, with reduced adiposity. Altogether, these findings unravel previously unidentified characteristics for LS, which could represent a metabolic benefit for patients, but may also participate to the development or worsening of some traits of the disease. Beyond LS, they also highlight a protective role of SHP2 global LS-mimicking modulation toward the development of obesity and associated disorders. ",10.1073/pnas.1406107111
PTPN11,T468M,"LEOPARD syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition related to Noonan syndrome, although it occurs less frequently. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical and molecular features of a large series of LEOPARD syndrome patients.
We collected clinical data from 19 patients in 10 hospitals. Bidirectional sequencing analysis of PTPN11, RAF1, and BRAF focused on exons carrying recurrent mutations.
After facial dysmorphism, structural heart defects (88%) were the most common feature described. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (71%) was diagnosed more often than pulmonary valve stenosis (35%). Multiple lentigines or café au lait spots were found in 84% of the series, and deafness was diagnosed in 3 patients. Mutations in PTPN11 were identified in 16 (84%) patients (10 patients had the recurrent LEOPARD syndrome mutation, p.Thr468Met) (NP_002825.3T468M). Two other patients had a mutation in RAF, and 1 patient had a mutation in BRAF. When compared with other neurocardiofaciocutaneous syndromes, LEOPARD syndrome patients showed a higher prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cutaneous abnormalities, and a lower prevalence of pulmonary valve stenosis and short stature.
LEOPARD syndrome patients display distinctive features apart from multiple lentigines, such as a higher prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and lower prevalence of short stature. Given its clinical implications, active search for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is warranted in Noonan syndrome spectrum patients, especially in LEOPARD syndrome patients.",10.1016/j.rec.2012.09.015
PTPN11,T468M,"Diagnosis within RASopathies still represents a challenge. Nevertheless, many efforts have been made by clinicians to identify specific clinical features which might help in differentiating one disorder from another. Here, we describe a child initially diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome. The follow-up of the proband, the clinical evaluation of his father together with a gene-by-gene testing approach led us to the proper diagnosis.
We report a 8-year-old male with multiple café-au-lait macules, several lentigines and dysmorphic features that suggest Noonan syndrome initially diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome. However, after a few years of clinical and ophthalmological follow-up, the absence of typical features of Neurofibromatosis type 1 and the lack of NF1 mutation led us to reconsider the original diagnosis. A new examination of the patient and his similarly affected father, who was initially referred as healthy, led us to suspect LEOPARD syndrome, The diagnosis was then confirmed by the occurrence in both patients of a heterozygous mutation c.1403 C > T, p.(Thr468Met), of PTPN11. Subsequently, the proband was also found to have type-1 Arnold-Chiari malformation in association with syringomyelia.
Our experience suggests that differential clinical diagnosis among RASopathies remains ambiguous and raises doubts on the current diagnostic clinical criteria. In some cases, genetic tests represent the only conclusive proof for a correct diagnosis and, consequently, for establishing individual prognosis and providing adequate follow-up. Thus, molecular testing represents an essential tool in differential diagnosis of RASophaties. This view is further strengthened by the increasing accessibility of new sequencing techniques.Finally, to our knowledge, the described case represents the third report of the occurrence of Arnold Chiari malformation and the second description of syringomyelia with LEOPARD syndrome.",10.1186/1471-2350-15-44
PTPN11,T468M,"Medulloblastoma is the commonest brain tumor in childhood and in a minority of patients is associated with an underlying genetic disorder such as Gorlin syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis. Increased susceptibility to certain tumors, including neuroblastoma and some hematological malignancies, is recognized in disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding components of the RAS signaling pathway which include Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML; formerly called LEOPARD syndrome), Costello syndrome, Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, Legius syndrome, and Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), collectively termed RASopathies. Although an association between medulloblastoma and NF1 has been reported, this tumor has not previously been reported in other RASopathies. We present a patient with NSML caused by the recurrent PTPN11 mutation c.1403C > T (p.Thr468Met) in whom medulloblastoma was diagnosed at age 10 years. Medulloblastoma could therefore be part of the tumor spectrum associated with this disorder.",10.1002/ajmg.a.36005
PTPN11,T468M,"The RAS/MAPK pathway proteins with germline mutations in their respective genes are associated with some disorders such as Noonan, LEOPARD (LS), neurofibromatosis type 1, Costello and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndromes. LEOPARD is an acronym, mnemonic for the major manifestations of this disorder, characterized by multiple lentigines, electrocardiographic abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonic stenosis, abnormal genitalia, retardation of growth, and sensorineural deafness. Though it is not included in the acronym, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most frequent cardiac anomaly observed, representing a potentially life-threatening problem in these patients. PTPN11, RAF1 and BRAF are the genes known to be associated with LS, identifying molecular genetic testing of the 3 gene mutations in about 95% of affected individuals. PTPN11 mutations are the most frequently found. Eleven different missense PTPN11 mutations (Tyr279Cys/Ser, Ala461Thr, Gly464Ala, Thr468Met/Pro, Arg498Trp/Leu, Gln506Pro, and Gln510Glu/Pro) have been reported so far in LS, 2 of which (Tyr279Cys and Thr468Met) occur in about 65% of the cases.

PTPN11,T468M,"The RAS-MAPK pathway is critical for human growth and development. Abnormalities at different steps of this signaling cascade result in neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous syndromes, or the RASopathies, a group of disorders with overlapping yet distinct phenotypes. RASopathy patients have variable degrees of intellectual disability, poor growth, relative macrocephaly, ectodermal abnormalities, dysmorphic features, and increased risk for certain malignancies. Congenital heart disease, particularly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and pulmonic stenosis, are prominent features in these disorders. Significant locus heterogeneity exists for many of the RASopathies. Traditionally, these diseases were thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. However, recently patients with defects in two components of this pathway and overlapping features of various forms of Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis 1 and have been reported. Here we present a patient with severe, progressive neonatal HCM, elevated urinary catecholamine metabolites, and dysmorphic features in whom we identified a known LEOPARD syndrome-associated PTPN11 mutation (c.1403 C > T; p.T468M) and a novel, potentially pathogenic missense SOS1 variant (c.1018 C > T; p.P340S) replacing a rigid nonpolar imino acid with a polar amino acid at a highly conserved position.

PTPN11,T468M,"Noonan syndrome (NS) and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are well-defined entities. The association of both disorders is called neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS), a disorder that has been related to mutations in the NF1 gene. Both NS and NFNS display phenotypic overlapping with LEOPARD syndrome (LS), and differential diagnosis between these two entities often represents a challenge for clinicians. We report on three patients (two brothers and a not-related patient) diagnosed as having NFNS. They fulfilled NF1 diagnostic criteria and had some features of NS. The three of them had hypertophic cardiomyopathy while neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, and unidentified bright objects on MRI were absent. PTPN11 gene assays revealed a T468M mutation, typical of LS. Thorough clinical examinations of the patients revealed multiple lentigines, which were considered to be freckling in the initial evaluation. We conclude that NF1 clinical criteria should be used with caution in patients with features of NS. Patients with hyperpigmented cutaneous spots associated with cardiac anomalies, even if fulfilling the minimal NF1 criteria for diagnosis, should be strongly considered for LS diagnosis.",10.1007/s00431-011-1418-5
PTPN11,T468M,"Five familial cases exhibited ephelides-like multiple lentigines, and we examined three of them, a mother and two sons. All three patients presented with small dark-brown maculae on the face and neck and electrocardiographic abnormalities. These findings sufficed to fulfill the criteria for LEOPARD syndrome (multiple lentigines syndrome), although they lacked five of seven major clinical features. However, the family members presented with a webbed neck and pectus excavatum, which are more frequently seen in Turner or Noonan syndrome. Histological examination of the lentigines revealed slightly elongated rete ridges, a hyperpigmented basal layer, and melanophages in the papillary dermis. Direct sequencing of the patients' genomic DNA revealed that all three had a consistent missense mutation [c.1403C > T (p.T468M)] in the PTPN11 gene, confirming LEOPARD syndrome with an atypical phenotype. It was suggested that LEOPARD syndrome shows a diverse phenotype but its diagnosis can be verified by mutation analysis.",10.1111/j.1365-4632.2010.04559.x

PTPN11,T468M,"Mutations in genes coding for transducers participating in the RAS/MAPK pathway have been identified as the molecular cause underlying a group of clinically related developmental disorders with cognitive deficits of variable severity. To determine the spectrum of cognitive defects associated with dysregulation of this signal cascade, we studied the profile of cognitive abilities in patients with mutations affecting the PTPN11, SOS1, HRAS, KRAS, BRAF, RAF1, and MEK1 genes and phenotype-genotype correlations. Our findings support the observation that heterogeneity in cognitive abilities can be at least partially ascribed to the individual affected genes and type of mutation involved. While mutations affecting transducers upstream of RAS were less frequently associated with mental retardation, mutations in downstream components of the pathway were generally associated with a more severe cognitive impairment. Among patients with a heterozygous PTPN11 mutation, the T468M substitution was associated with a mean IQ significantly higher compared to that of individuals carrying the N308D change. Our study provides insights on the range of cognitive abilities in patients with gene mutations causing dysregulation of RAS signaling suggesting that the presence and severity of cognitive involvement can be predicted in part by the gene involved.",10.1002/ajmg.a.32488
PTPN11,T468M,"We report a patient with a clinical and molecular diagnosis of LEOPARD syndrome (LS) associated with multiple granular cell tumors (MGCT). Bidirectional sequencing of exons 7, 12, and 13 of the PTPN11 gene revealed the T468M missense mutation in exon 12. This mutation has been previously reported in patients with LS. To our knowledge, this is the first report of MGCT associated with molecularly characterized LS and provides the first molecular evidence linking granular cell tumors (GCT) to the Ras/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. We propose that MGCT can be associated with LS. Analysis of GCT from this case tested negatively for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the PTPN11 and NF1 loci and did not show deletions of the PTEN gene. The absence of LOH of PTPN11 supports published functional data that T468M is a dominant-negative mutation.",10.1111/j.1399-0004.2008.01100.x
PTPN11,T468M,"Missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, cause clinically similar but distinctive disorders, LEOPARD (LS) and Noonan (NS) syndromes. The LS is an autosomal dominant disorder with pleomorphic developmental abnormalities including lentigines, cardiac defects, short stature and deafness. Biochemical analyses indicated that LS alleles engender loss-of-function (LOF) effects, while NS mutations result in gain-of-function (GOF). These biochemical findings lead to an enigma that how PTPN11 mutations with opposite effects on function result in disorders that are so similar. To study the developmental effects of the commonest LS PTPN11 alleles (Y279C and T468M), we generated LS transgenic fruitflies using corkscrew (csw), the Drosophila orthologue of PTPN11. Ubiquitous expression of the LS csw mutant alleles resulted in ectopic wing veins and, for the Y279C allele, rough eyes with increased R7 photoreceptor numbers. These were GOF phenotypes mediated by increased RAS/MAPK signaling and requiring the LS mutant's residual phosphatase activity. Our findings provide the first evidence that LS mutant alleles have GOF developmental effects despite reduced phosphatase activity, providing a rationale for how PTPN11 mutations with GOF and LOF produce similar but distinctive syndromes.",10.1093/hmg/ddn336
PTPN11,T468M,"Missense PTPN11 mutations cause Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes (NS and LS), two developmental disorders with pleiomorphic phenotypes. PTPN11 encodes SHP2, an SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase functioning as a signal transducer. Generally, different substitutions of a particular amino acid residue are observed in these diseases, indicating that the crucial factor is the residue being replaced. For a few codons, only one substitution is observed, suggesting the possibility of specific roles for the residue introduced. We analyzed the biochemical behavior and ligand-binding properties of all possible substitutions arising from single-base changes affecting codons 42, 139, 279, 282 and 468 to investigate the mechanisms underlying the invariant occurrence of the T42A, E139D and I282V substitutions in NS and the Y279C and T468M changes in LS. Our data demonstrate that the isoleucine-to-valine change at codon 282 is the only substitution at that position perturbing the stability of SHP2's closed conformation without impairing catalysis, while the threonine-to-alanine change at codon 42, but not other substitutions of that residue, promotes increased phosphopeptide-binding affinity. The recognition specificity of the C-SH2 domain bearing the E139D substitution differed substantially from its wild-type counterpart acquiring binding properties similar to those observed for the N-SH2 domain, revealing a novel mechanism of SHP2's functional dysregulation. Finally, while functional selection does not seem to occur for the substitutions at codons 279 and 468, we point to deamination of the methylated cytosine at nucleotide 1403 as the driving factor leading to the high prevalence of the T468M change in LS.",10.1093/hmg/ddn099
PTPN11,T468M,"We report on a family with LEOPARD syndrome which was molecularly proven (p.Thr468Met in PTPN11) in a father and his adult son. The father had multiple lentigines dispersed equally over his body; the son was similarly affected except for the left part of thorax, back and left arm, which were completely devoid of lentigines and only showed a few nevi. In addition, the son was found to have a mosaic karyotype, 47,XYY/46,XY, in lymphocytes. Skin biopsies from the pigmented and unpigmented forearm showed that mainly a 47,XYY karyotype was present in the pigmented skin and mainly a 46,XY karyotype in the unpigmented skin. In both fibroblast cultures the PTPN11 mutation was present, and no additional mutation could be detected. We discuss the various possible explanations for this phenotype, which include the possibility of coincidence; revertant mosaicism; silencing of a second PTPN11 mutation; gene(s) located on a sex chromosome influencing the phenotype; and epigenetic influences. We favor that the co-occurrence of a sex chromosome mosaicism and mosaicism for skin symptoms in a single patient with LEOPARD syndrome is coincidence, but that mosaicism for LEOPARD skin symptoms in itself may well be more frequent and needs additional studies. Each of the above-hypothesized mechanisms may then remain possible.",10.1002/ajmg.a.31991
PTPN11,T468M,"Germline mutations in PTPN11, the gene encoding the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, cause Noonan syndrome (NS) and the clinically related LEOPARD syndrome (LS), whereas somatic mutations in the same gene contribute to leukemogenesis. On the basis of our previously gathered genetic and biochemical data, we proposed a model that splits NS- and leukemia-associated PTPN11 mutations into two major classes of activating lesions with differential perturbing effects on development and hematopoiesis. To test this model, we investigated further the diversity of germline and somatic PTPN11 mutations, delineated the association of those mutations with disease, characterized biochemically a panel of mutant SHP-2 proteins recurring in NS, LS, and leukemia, and performed molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural effects of selected mutations. Our results document a strict correlation between the identity of the lesion and disease and demonstrate that NS-causative mutations have less potency for promoting SHP-2 gain of function than do leukemia-associated ones. Furthermore, we show that the recurrent LS-causing Y279C and T468M amino acid substitutions engender loss of SHP-2 catalytic activity, identifying a previously unrecognized behavior for this class of missense PTPN11 mutations.",10.1086/499925
PTPN11,T468M,"PTPN11 gene mutations are common to both patients with Noonan (NS) and LEOPARD syndrome (LS). So far only two recurrent mutations have been identified in LS patients by different research groups, i.e., Tyr279Cys and Thr468Met. In this work we describe the third PTPN11 mutation that has been found in a single LS patient. The mutation (c.1517A>C) substitutes a proline for a glutamine at amino acid 506 (Gln506Pro) in the phosphatase domain (PTP) of the PTPN11 peptide SHP2. This region is a mutation hotspot. Changes at amino acids 501 to 504 cause NS. Gln506Pro is predicted, by modeling analysis, to seriously disrupt the normal contacts between the regulating N-SH2 and the active PTP domains, leading to hyperactivity of the phosphatase. This report demonstrates that rarer mutations other than Tyr279Cys and Thr468Met can be found in LS patients and the need of screening the whole gene in those negative for the commonest mutations.",10.1002/humu.9149

We used bidirectional sequencing of exons 3 and 8, considered as PTPN11 mutation hot spots, and then compared the rate of mutational events of these exons between different populations using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests.
We detected 3 heterozygous mutations (Asp6lGly, Tyr63Cys, and Asn308Ser) in 4 individuals of 16 sporadic patients (25%). The rate of mutation in our cohort did not differ from that of other populations. However, we found significant differences in the mutation rate of exon 8 between one Japanese cohort and some populations, which requires more investigations to be explained.
The present study allowed identification of mutations clustered in exons 3 and 8 of the PTPN11 gene in a Moroccan Noonan syndrome cohort and enabled us to give appropriate genetic counseling to the mutation-positive patients.",10.3906/sag-1310-50
PTPN11,Y63C,"Activating mutations in PTPN11 cause Noonan syndrome, the most common nonchromosomal disorder affecting development and growth. PTPN11 encodes SHP2, an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase that positively modulates RAS function. Here, we characterized functionally all possible amino acid substitutions arising from single-base changes affecting codons 62 and 63 to explore the molecular mechanisms lying behind the largely invariant occurrence of the Y62D and Y63C substitutions recurring in Noonan syndrome. We provide structural and biochemical data indicating that the autoinhibitory interaction between the N-SH2 and protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domains is perturbed in both mutants as a result of an extensive structural rearrangement of the N-SH2 domain. Most mutations affecting Tyr(63) exerted an unpredicted disrupting effect on the structure of the N-SH2 phosphopeptide-binding cleft mediating the interaction of SHP2 with signaling partners. Among all the amino acid changes affecting that codon, the disease-causing mutation was the only substitution that perturbed the stability of the inactive conformation of SHP2 without severely impairing proper phosphopeptide binding of N-SH2. On the other hand, the disruptive effect of the Y62D change on the autoinhibited conformation of the protein was balanced, in part, by less efficient binding properties of the mutant. Overall, our data demonstrate that the selection-by-function mechanism acting as driving force for PTPN11 mutations affecting codons 62 and 63 implies balancing of counteracting effects operating on the allosteric control of the function of SHP2.",10.1074/jbc.M112.350231
PTPN11,Y63C,"Human growth is a highly complicated process, but it is obviously influenced by a genetic factor. Recent genome-wide linkage analyses suggested some genetic regions underlying stature variations. However, any specific genes underlying stature variations have not been identified. Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder clinically characterized by short stature, minor facial anomalies, and congenital heart defects. Recently, PTPN11 (protein-tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor-type 11) has been identified as a major responsible gene for NS, causing about half of the affected individuals. We herein report a large family demonstrating NS caused by one of the common PTPN11 mutations, c.188 A > G (Y63C). In this family, the patients were apparently healthy, but heterozygosity of the c.188 A > G (Y63C) mutation was related to growth impairment. This finding suggested that PTPN11 genetic variants contribute to adult height in the general population. However, c.188 A > G (Y63C) was not identified in 96 short individuals from the general population of 2,281 healthy adults. Thus, it is unlikely that PTPN11 is one of the genes underlying stature variations in the general population.",10.1620/tjem.208.255
PTPN11,Y63C,"We surveyed 16 subjects with the clinical diagnosis of Noonan Syndrome (NS1) from 12 families and their relevant family members for mutations in PTPN11/SHP2 using direct DNA sequencing. We found three different mutations among five families. Two unrelated subjects shared the same de novo missense substitution in exon 13 (S502T); an additional two unrelated families had a mutation in exon 3 (Y63C); and one subject had the amino acid substitution Y62D, also in exon 3. None of the three mutations were present in ethnically matched controls. In the mature protein model, the exon 3 mutants and the exon 13 mutant amino acids cluster at the interface between the N' SH2 domain and the phosphatase catalytic domain. Six of eight subjects with PTPN11/SHP2 mutations had pulmonary valve stenosis while no mutations were identified in those subjects (N = 4) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. An additional four subjects with possible Noonan syndrome were evaluated, but no mutations in PTPN11/SHP2 were identified. These results confirm that mutations in PTPN11/SHP2 underlie a common form of Noonan syndrome, and that the disease exhibits both allelic and locus heterogeneity. The observation of recurrent mutations supports the hypothesis that a special class of gain-of-function mutations in SHP2 give rise to Noonan syndrome.",10.1002/humu.10129
PTPN11,Y63C,"Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder defined by short stature, delayed puberty, and characteristic dysmorphic features. Tartaglia et al. (Nature Genetics, 29:465-468) have recently shown that gain-of-function mutations in the gene PTPN11 (protein-tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor-type 11) cause Noonan syndrome in roughly half of patients that they examined. To further explore the relevance of PTPN11 mutations to the pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome, we analyzed the PTPN11 gene in 21 Japanese patients. Mutation analysis of the 15 coding exons and their flanking introns by denaturing HPLC and direct sequencing revealed six different heterozygous missense mutations (Asp61Gly, Tyr63Cys, Ala72Ser, Thr73Ile, Phe285Ser, and Asn308Asp) in seven cases (six sporadic and one familial). The mutations clustered either in the N-Src homology 2 domain or in the protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain. The clinical features of the mutation-positive and mutation-negative patients were comparable. The results provide further support to the notion that PTPN11 mutations are responsible for the development of Noonan syndrome in a substantial fraction of patients and that relatively infrequent features of Noonan syndrome, such as sensory deafness and bleeding diathesis, can also result from mutations of PTPN11.",10.1210/jcem.87.8.8694
PTPN11,E69Q,"To evaluate the spectrum of PTPN11 gene mutations in Noonan syndrome patients and to study the genotype-phenotype associations.
In this study, twenty Noonan syndrome patients with PTPN11 mutations were included. The patients underwent a detailed clinical and physical evaluation. To identify inherited cases, parents of all mutation positive patients were analyzed.
Thirteen different PTPN11 mutations, two of them being novel, were detected in the study group. These mutations included eleven missense mutations: p.G60A, p.D61N, p.Y62D, p.Y63C, p.E69Q, p.Q79R, p.Y279C,p.N308D, p.N308S, p.M504V, p.Q510R and two novel missense mutations: p.I56V and p.I282M. The frequency of cardiac abnormalities and short stature were found to be 80 % and 80 %, respectively. Mental retardation was not observed in patients having exon 8 mutations. No significant correlations were detected between other phenotypic features and genotypes.

SOS1,K170E,"Noonan and Noonan-like syndromes are multisystem genetic disorders, mainly with autosomal dominant trasmission, caused by mutations in several genes. Missense pathogenetic variants of SOS1 gene are the second most common cause of Noonan syndrome (NS) and account approximately for 13% to 17% of cases. Subjects carrying a pathogenetic variant in SOS1 gene tend to exhibit a distinctive phenotype that is characterized by ectodermal abnormalities. Cutis verticis gyrata (CVG) is a rare disease, congenital or acquired, characterized by the redundancy of skin on scalp, forming thick skin folds and grooves of similar aspect to cerebral cortex gyri. Several references in the literature have reported association between nonessential primary form of CVG and NS.
we report two cases of newborns with CVG and phenotype suggestive for NS who have been diagnosed to harbour the same pathogenetic variant in SOS1 gene.
previously described patients with NS presenting CVG had received only clinical diagnosis. Therefore we report the first patients with CVG in which the clinical suspicion of NS is confirmed by molecolar analysis.",10.1186/s13052-022-01340-4
SOS1,K170E,"To investigate mutation spectrums and their correlations to phenotypes in Noonan syndrome (NS) and NS-related disorders that share functional alterations of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.
Clinical characteristics and genotypes of 10 previously known and 2 candidate genes, SPRY1-4 and SPRED1, were investigated in 59 patients with NS, 17 with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, 5 with Costello syndrome, and 2 with LEOPARD syndrome.
PTPN11 (39.0%), SOS1 (20.3%), RAF1 (6.8%), KRAS (5.1%), and BRAF (1.7%) mutations were identified in NS; BRAF (41.2%), SHOC2 (23.5%), and MEK1 (5.9%) mutations in cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome; and HRAS and PTPN11 mutations in Costello syndrome and LEOPARD syndrome, respectively. No additional mutations were identified in 28.9% of NS and 35.3% of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. Functional characterizations of 2 RAF1 novel variants, p.P261T and p.S259T, and one SOS1 variant, p.K170E, showed enhanced activity of Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Normal stature was frequent in SOS1 mutations, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in RAF1, and developmental delay in RAF1, BRAF, or SHOC2 mutations.
By identifying genotype-phenotype correlations, our study highlights the role of molecular genetic testing in the process of differential diagnosis of NS and NS-related disorders. Pathophysiologies that underlie these correlations are needed to be investigated in terms of their effects on Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.",10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.05.024
SOS1,K170E,"After 2006, germline mutations in the KRAS, SOS1, and RAF1 genes were reported to cause Noonan syndrome (NS), in addition to the PTPN11 gene, and now we can find the etiology of disease in approximately 60-70% of NS cases. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between phenotype and genotype by molecular analysis of the PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, and RAF1 genes in 59 Korean patients with NS. We found disease-causing mutations in 30 (50.8%) patients, which were located in the PTPN11 (27.1%), SOS1 (16.9%), KRAS (1.7%), and RAF1 (5.1%) genes. Three novel mutations (T59A in PTPN11, K170E in SOS1, S259T in RAF1) were identified. The patients with PTPN11 mutations showed higher prevalences of patent ductus arteriosus and thrombocytopenia. The patients with SOS1 mutations had a lower prevalence of delayed psychomotor development. All patients with RAF1 mutations had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Typical facial features and auxological parameters were, on statistical analysis, not significantly different between the groups. The molecular defects of NS are genetically heterogeneous and involve several genes other than PTPN11 related to the RAS-MAPK pathway.",10.1007/s10038-008-0343-6
SOS1,I252T,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is a genetic condition characterized by congenital heart defects, short stature and characteristic facial features. We here present the case of a girl with moderate learning disabilities, delayed language development, craniofacial features and skin anomalies reminiscent of NS. After a mutation screening of the known NS genes PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, GRB2, BRAF and SHOC2 we found the heterozygous c.755T>C variant in SOS1 causing the p.I252T amino-acid substitution, which was considered possibly pathogenetic by bioinformatic predictions. The same variant was present in the proband's mother, displaying some NS features, and maternal grandfather showing no NS traits, but also by a healthy subject in 1000 genomes project database without phenotype informations. The functional analysis revealed that SOS1 c.755C activated the RAS-ERK intracellular pathway, whereas no effects on RAC-JNK cascade have been detected. After a comparison between the sequence of SOS1 cDNA from peripheral blood and SOS1 genomic DNA, we showed for the first time a differential allelic expression of the SOS1 gene in healthy individuals, thus occurring as a physiologic condition. Interestingly, we found that the mutated allele C was 50% more expressed than the wild-type allele T in all familial carriers. The comparable amount of SOS1 mRNA between mutated individuals and the controls indicates that the variant does not affect SOS1 expression. The present study provides a first evidence of allelic imbalance of SOS1 and pinpoints this condition as a possible mechanism underlying a different penetrance of some SOS1-mutated alleles in unrelated carriers.

This dogma has been challenged by recent descriptions of patients with enlarged nerves or paraspinal tumors, suggesting that neurogenic tumors and hypertrophic neuropathy may be a complication of Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML) or RASopathy phenotype. We describe a 15-year-old boy, whose mother previously received clinical diagnosis of NF1 due to presence of bilateral cervical and lumbar spinal lesions resembling plexiform neurofibromas and features suggestive of NS. NF1 molecular analysis was negative in the mother. The boy presented with Noonan features, multiple lentigines and pectus excavatum. Next-generation sequencing analysis of all RASopathy genes identified p.Ser548Arg missense mutation in SOS1 in the boy, confirmed in his mother. Brain and spinal magnetic resonance imaging scans were negative in the boy. No heart involvement or deafness was observed in proband or mother. This is the first report of a SOS1 mutation associated with hypertrophic neuropathy resembling plexiform neurofibromas, a rare complication in Noonan phenotypes with mutations in RASopathy genes.

Mutational analysis of PTPN11 gene was performed in 15 Iranian patients, using PCR and Sanger sequencing at phase one. Then, as phase two, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in the form of targeted resequencing was utilized for analysis of exons from other related genes. Homology modelling for the novel founded mutations was performed as well. The genotype, phenotype correlation was done according to the molecular findings and clinical features.
Previously reported mutation (p.N308D) in some patients and a novel mutation (p.D155N) in one of the patients were identified in phase one. After applying NGS methods, known and new variants were found in four patients in other genes, including: CBL (p. V904I), KRAS (p. L53W), SOS1 (p. I1302V), and SOS1 (p. R552G). Structural studies of two deduced novel mutations in related genes revealed deficiencies in the mutated proteins. Following genotype, phenotype correlation, a new pattern of the presence of intellectual disability in two patients was registered.
NS shows strong variable expressivity along the high genetic heterogeneity especially in distinct populations and ethnic groups. Also possibly unknown other causative genes may be exist.

SOS1,E433K,"Noonan syndrome (NS) and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFC) are related disorders associated with disrupted RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signalling. NS, characterised by facial dysmorphism, congenital heart defects and short stature, is caused by mutations in the genes PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS and RAF1. CFC is distinguished from NS by the presence of ectodermal abnormalities and more severe mental retardation in addition to the NS phenotype. The genetic aetiology of CFC was recently assigned to four genes: BRAF, KRAS, MEK1 and MEK2.
A comprehensive mutation analysis of BRAF, KRAS, MEK1, MEK2 and SOS1 in 31 unrelated patients without mutations in PTPN11 is presented.
Mutations were identified in seven patients with CFC (two in BRAF, one in KRAS, one in MEK1, two in MEK2 and one in SOS1). Two mutations were novel: MEK1 E203Q and MEK2 F57L. The SOS1 E433K mutation, identified in a patient diagnosed with CFC, has previously been reported in patients with NS. In one patient with NS, we also identified a mutation, BRAF K499E, that has previously been reported in patients with CFC. We thus suggest involvement of BRAF in the pathogenesis of NS also.
Taken together, our results indicate that the molecular and clinical overlap between CFC and NS is more complex than previously suggested and that the syndromes might even represent allelic disorders.
